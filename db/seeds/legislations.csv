This plan aims to strengthen the country's path towards sustainable, climate-resilient development while achieving low carbon climate resilient development. It builds on the previous Action Plan spanning the period 2013-2017. The NCCAP consists in three documents, including an Adaptation Technical Analysis Report (volume II), and a Mitigation Technical Analysis Report (volume III).

The Plan seeks in particular to: 1) reduce risks to communities and infrastructure resulting from climate-related disasters such as droughts and floods, 2) Increase food and nutrition security through enhanced productivity and resilience of the agricultural sector in as low- carbon manner as possible, 3) Enhance resilience of the Blue Economy and water sector by ensuring access to and efficient use of water for agriculture, manufacturing, domestic, wildlife and other uses, 4) Increase forest cover to 10% of total land area; rehabilitate degraded lands, including rangelands; increase resilience of the wildlife and tourism sector, 5) Mainstream climate change adaptation into the health sector; and increase the resilience of human settlements, including improved solid waste management in urban areas, 6) Improve energy and resource efficiency in the manufacturing sector, and 7) Climate-proof energy and transport infrastructure; encourage electricity supply based on renewable energy; encourage the transition to clean cooking; and develop sustainable transport systems.

The Strategic Framework for Climate Policy sets out the vision and objectives of national climate policy to 2030. It notably aims to promote the rapprochement of citizens and civil society, foster the implementation of a new generation of climate policy instruments, and articulate objectives, instruments and institutions, recognising that the mainstreaming of climate policies and the need to integrate the climate dimension into sectoral policies requires an integrated and integrated vision of policies and instruments.

Its objectives are: 1) Promoting the transition to a low carbon economy, generating more wealth and employment, contributing to green growth; 2) Ensure a sustainable path to reduce GHG emissions; 3) Strengthen resilience and national adaptation capacities; 4) ensure committed participation in international negotiations and cooperation; 5) to stimulate research, innovation and the production of knowledge; 6) Involve society in the challenges of climate change, contributing to increase individual and collective action; 7) Increase the effectiveness of information, reporting and monitoring systems; 8) Guarantee financing conditions and increase levels of investment; and 9) Ensure effective governance conditions and ensure mainstreaming of climate objectives.

 

The PNAC is one of the elements that constitute the QEPiC that assumed as vision the development of a competitive and low carbon economy, establishing a new paradigm of development for Portugal in a context of green growth.

Its objectives are: 1)) establish policy guidelines and sectoral measures based on the cost-effective emission reduction potential identified in the modelling; 2) Define sectorial targets that conspire the objectives of reducing national emissions resulting from the CCV and foreseen in the QEPiC; and 3) Identifies a set of policy options and sectoral measures with a cost-effective potential, to be developed within the framework of the work of the SPM, which ensures sectoral operationalisation and accountability in its implementation.

 

In order to contribute to the planning and development of a resilient, competitive and low carbon society and economy, ENAAC 2020 sets the following vision: ""a country adapted to the effects of climate change, through the continuous implementation of solutions based on the technical knowledge and best practices."" It aims to 1) improve the level of knowledge on climate change; 2) implement adaptation measures; and 3) promote the integration of adaptation into sectoral policies.
