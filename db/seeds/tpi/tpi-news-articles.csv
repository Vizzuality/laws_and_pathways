"55","Response to the Reclaim Finance blog post “The TPI benchmark: misleading approach, dangerous conclusion”","<div>In its blog post published on the 6th December, Reclaim Finance comments on the TPI’s updated company scores for the energy cluster published in the TPI online tool. They made an attempt to challenge TPI methodologies and individual alignment scores of companies.<br><br>We find that the Reclaim Finance blog post misrepresents TPI’s analysis. TPI provides a wide range of indicators and different, complementary analyses, which together try to provide a holistic view of companies’ progress on climate change. These indicators and analyses need to be looked at together, not in isolation. Reclaim Finance instead selectively discusses individual elements of our data to give a misleading impression.<br><br>The point of our Carbon Performance methodology is to assess the ambition of corporate emissions targets. That is precisely why our projections of company emissions in the future are based on their targets. But this analysis is complemented by a wide range of other indicators, which look at what managerial and governance steps companies are taking.<br><br>Despite the impression Reclaim Finance tries to give, Scope 3 targets are a core element of our analysis of corporate climate action in sectors where Scope 3 emissions are an important share of lifecycle emissions, such as oil and gas, automobile manufacturing, and mining. Indeed, without a Scope 3 emissions target, oil and gas companies are far from alignment with low-carbon scenarios.<br><br>Similarly, we analyse the alignment of companies not only in the long term (i.e., 2050), but also in the short and medium term (e.g., 2030). It is clear from our analysis that companies such as TotalEnergies and RWE are not aligned in the short term, but, if they deliver on their targets, they will bring their emissions intensities below low-carbon benchmarks in the long term. Any company that has a higher-than-average emissions intensity today is going to be above the benchmarks for a period of time. Unfortunately, science does not give an unambiguous answer to exactly when an individual company needs to align. That is why we choose to show the whole pathway for each company. Investors may decide how to act on the information.</div>",,,"2021-12-06 10:26:00 UTC"

To help investors stay ahead of the curve, the TPI team is introducing new benchmark low-carbon scenarios to our <a href=""https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/methodology"">Carbon Performance</a> analysis, including a pathway to holding the global temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. According to the <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a>, restricting the global temperature increase to this level would substantially reduce the probability of extreme weather events, biodiversity loss, sea level rise, water scarcity, and food insecurity, with enormous implications for loss of life and adaptation costs.<br><br></div><div>The new benchmark will be built using the International Energy Agency (IEA) report ‘<a href=""https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/4482cac7-edd6-4c03-b6a2-8e79792d16d9/NetZeroby2050-ARoadmapfortheGlobalEnergySector.pdf"">Net Zero by 2050</a>’, which sets out a pathway for the global energy sector to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century and keep the temperature rise to 1.5°C with a 50% probability. Achieving these targets will require a transformation of the energy systems that define our economies; it will be unparalleled in size and scope.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The 1.5 Degrees scenario will become the most ambitious of the TPI benchmarks. Its release will be accompanied by an update of the other TPI benchmarks: ‘National Pledges’, building on the IEA’s STEPS scenario with national targets announced as of mid-2020, and a Below 2 Degrees scenario building on the IEA’s SDS scenario, which holds the temperature rise to below 1.8 °C with a 66% probability [1]. The National Pledges scenario will replace TPI’s current Paris Pledges scenario, which was based on the Nationally Determined Contributions announced in Paris in 2015.<br><br></div><div>The update of the TPI benchmarks comes at a time when the need for a more ambitious energy transition is increasingly recognised by the investor and policymaking community. It will enable the work of Climate Action 100+ to consider the implications for companies’ targets and alignment to the goals of the initiative.<br><br></div><div>&nbsp;As the science and economics of climate change develop, so does our understanding of what it takes to fulfil the aims of the Paris Agreement. These new benchmark scenarios are intended to keep up with recent policy developments and what is required to limit temperatures to 1.5°C and well below 2°C. We look forward to continuing to support investors with our <a href=""https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/sectors"">TPI tool</a>.<br><br></div><div>TPI’s next annual assessment of the energy sector in October will be our first report to measure companies’ decarbonisation efforts using the 1.5°C and the updated TPI’s pathways.<br><br></div><div><br><br>[1] TPI will use IEA data to create sectoral benchmarks for all TPI sectors covered by the ETP2020 and NZE2050. Additional data sources are being identified to cover those TPI sectors, which are excluded either from both ETP2020 and NZE2050 (autos and paper) or from NZE2050 (aluminium).&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>",,"Net Zero;benchmark;1.5 degrees scenario","2021-09-08 10:00:00 UTC"

Consumption of oil must begin to fall in the next few years and fall substantially thereafter – far from the gentle plateauing expected by many in the industry. Gas consumption, considered by the industry to be a “growth engine”, must begin to decline by 2030. Most European oil and gas companies have responded to investor pressure by updating their emission targets, describing them as being consistent with net zero. Research shows that this is not the case. </em><strong><em>Dan Gardiner, Rory Sullivan, Simon Dietz, </em></strong><em>and </em><strong><em>Valentin Jahn</em></strong><em> say that oil and gas companies will have to go much further to genuinely claim 1.5C/net-zero alignment. For most, this is likely to require a substantial scaling back of investment in exploration and production activities, particularly for oil.<br><br></em>In October 2020, the IEA released its <a href=""https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2020"">World Energy Outlook 2020</a> containing, for the first time, a chapter on net zero. It sets out, at a high level, the actions needed across society to limit emissions from the energy sector to net zero by 2050, thus ensuring the increase in global temperature does not exceed 1.5oC above pre-industrial levels. The report states: “realising the pace and scale of emissions reduction … require[s] a far-reaching set of actions”.<br><br></div><div>IEA expects to publish its full net-zero scenario, with data out to 2050, by May 2021. While the published scenario is incomplete, based on the 2030 datapoints provided, it is possible to reach some preliminary conclusions about the implications for the energy sector. The actions do not sit exclusively with the energy industry — there is an extensive discussion on the role of behavioural change in lowering demand, for example – but clearly this is where the most profound change is needed. Figure 4.5 (pg 129) of the World Energy Outlook shows that, on top of a dramatic fall in coal consumption, global consumption of both oil and gas must fall to around 3,000 Mtoe by 2030, implying gas consumption must fall by about 10% from 2019 levels and oil consumption must fall by about 34%.<br><br><strong><br>Figure 1.

The IPCC in its<a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/""> Special Report on 1.5oC warming</a> set out four illustrative model pathways and their implications for reductions in oil and gas demand in both 2030 and 2050. Compared to the three pathways (P1, P2 and P3) that stipulate limited or no overshoot in global temperatures (i.e. no temporary increase beyond 1.5oC), the IEA’s 2030 estimate appears to be slightly below the middle of the range for oil (Figure 1) and above the middle of the range for gas. The data for oil are plotted in Figure 1, which presents: (a) historic trends in oil consumption (from BP’s <a href=""https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/energy-outlook/bp-energy-outlook-2020.pdf"">Energy Outlook</a>), (b) the <a href=""https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2020"">IEA</a> and <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/"">IPCC</a> scenarios, and (c) a net-zero scenario from BP’s Energy Outlook.<br><br></div><div>Taken together, the models suggest that, if global temperature increase is to be limited to 1.5oC, consumption of oil must begin to fall in the next few years, even from the current COVID-19 impacted levels, and continue falling thereafter. This is far from the gentle plateauing of oil demand at some point in the late 2020s expected by many in the industry. It also suggests that gas consumption, considered by the industry to be a “growth engine”, must begin to decline by 2030.<br><br></div><div>These findings have profound implications for E&amp;P (exploration and production) businesses and the upstream divisions of integrated companies. Figure 2 compares the IEA’s trajectory with models of oil supply from existing production facilities by <a href=""https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2020"">IEA</a>, <a href=""https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/energy-outlook/bp-energy-outlook-2020.pdf"">BP</a>, and <a href=""https://carbontracker.org/reports/breaking-the-habit/"">CTI</a>. This analysis suggests that there is very little, if any, justification for adding new oil supply. Essentially production from existing wells is enough to meet demand in a 1.5oC scenario. An almost complete and immediate stop in exploration and sanctioning of new oil fields would therefore be required to avoid locking in future oil production that would see temperatures exceed a 1.5oC increase.<br><br><strong><br>Figure 2.

Against a backdrop of increasing policy momentum for 1.5oC and falling renewable/battery costs, investors are increasingly keen to minimise the transition risks to their portfolio and ensure their holdings are aligned with net zero. Climate Action 100+, an investor initiative backed by over 450 investors with a total of $52 trillion in assets under management, uses TPI and Carbon Tracker analysis to drive its engagement activities, for example.<br><br></div><div>Over the last year most European oil and gas companies have responded to investor pressure by updating their emission targets. Many have described their new ambitions as being consistent with net zero. However, <a href=""https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/publications/58.pdf?type=Publication"">analysis by the TPI</a> based on existing IEA data concluded that none of them is, in fact, even aligned with 2oC, let alone 1.5oC. Carbon Tracker arrived at a <a href=""https://carbontracker.org/reports/absolute-impact/"">similar conclusion</a>. Critically most of the ambitions focus exclusively on reducing downstream emissions <em>intensity</em> without any commitment to lower absolute emissions or to reduce exploration and production activities.<br><br></div><div>When published in full, the IEA net-zero scenario is likely to reaffirm how much further oil and gas companies will have to go to genuinely claim net-zero alignment. They will need to lay out comprehensive strategic plans encompassing how their current intensity targets will impact absolute emissions and how they intend to align their upstream businesses and capital expenditure. For most, this is likely to require a substantial scaling back of investment in exploration and production activities, particularly for oil.<br><br></div><div>A rigorous framework will be needed to help investors assess these commitments. Over the last six months, drawing on feedback from the industry and others, a coalition of investors supported by Climate Action 100+ and co-ordinated by IIGCC has helped develop a sector-specific “net-zero standard”. This standard will build on the disclosure framework developed by Climate Action 100+ to drive its engagement activities, identifying the additional sector-specific actions oil and gas companies should undertake and the disclosure they should provide. This standard will be published in the first quarter of 2021.<br><br></div><div>With recent US elections and pledges from China, South Korea and Japan, momentum for stronger climate policies and net zero appears to be building. If we include the EU and the UK, economies accounting for roughly half of global oil and gas demand have now made some sort of commitment to net zero. Translating these commitments into action will be a huge effort, but with ever lower renewable and battery prices, delivery is now becoming technically and economically feasible. The IEA’s 2030 data confirms that there is substantial agreement between climate modellers about the implications of a net-zero policy environment for the oil and gas sector. Substantial falls in oil consumption in particular will be needed by 2030 and exploration activities should be severely curtailed. The extent and the speed of the actions required has yet to be fully communicated to investors or captured within most of the existing net-zero commitments made by the sector so far.<br><br></div><div><strong><em>Dan Gardiner, Rory Sullivan, Simon Dietz, </em></strong><em>and </em><strong><em>Valentin Jahn</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em></div><div><br><br></div>","Oil & Gas",,"2021-02-12 09:38:00 UTC"

The group’s new sustainability policy sets out its commitment to working with funders that are also on a journey to decarbonise.<br><br></div><div>We’re delighted that the Science Museum Group has chosen TPI’s tool as the robust and independent gauge it wishes to use to check that its partners or potential partners are progressing on a path to cut carbon emissions in line with the Paris Agreement.<br><br></div><div>TPI’s data-led methodology provides clarity for partners that aspire to work with the Science Museum and ensures they share similar values, while also providing transparency for the museum’s guests.<br><br></div><div>Today, society and public institutions expect corporate partners to behave in an ethical and sustainable way. TPI’s tool reveals which corporations from high emitting sectors are genuinely committed to a progressive transition plan aligned with the Paris Agreement to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C.<br><br></div><div>The Science Museum Group encourages corporate partnerships with firms that share its vision for a progressive transition to a low-carbon economy, even if they are currently high emitters. After all, it is not just about where you are now, but where you are going, and companies with a progressive roadmap towards decarbonising are encouraged to reach out and partner with the Science Museum.<br><br></div><div>For example, one company taking positive steps forward is the Science Museum’s partner Equinor.

"44","IIGCC sets out roadmap to net zero","<div><em>The development of the Net Zero Investment Framework is a big step forward. Now we must ensure that it meets the needs of all investors before completion.<br></em><br></div><div>One of the most positive developments of the last year, despite all of its turbulence, has been the emergence of net zero commitments by countries from the UK to New Zealand, and by over 900 companies.&nbsp; Net zero targets are consistent with the Paris Agreement goal to keep global warming well below 2°C and it is important that investors also look at how they can join the race to net zero.<br><br></div><div>However that is easier said than done.<br><br></div><div>Historically one of the main barriers to investors committing to net zero has been a lack of guidance on how to comprehensively reduce their climate impact. There has been no industry standard for what must be done to become a ‘net zero investor’ and no proven pathway to align investments with the scale and pace of transition required.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The good news is that this has started to change.<br><br></div><div><strong><em>A TCFD for Net Zero?<br></em></strong><br></div><div>This month TPI marked a key milestone when it was selected by the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (IIGCC) as one of the key components of a ‘<a href=""https://www.iigcc.org/news/16-trillion-investors-develop-first-ever-framework-for-net-zero-investing/"">Net Zero Investment Framework</a>’<br><br></div><div>The ‘<a href=""https://www.iigcc.org/news/16-trillion-investors-develop-first-ever-framework-for-net-zero-investing/"">Net Zero Investment Framework</a>’ is a major step forward because, for the first time, it gives the wider investment industry, both asset owners and asset managers, a sector-wide framework to define what becoming a ‘net zero investor’ really means.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Call it a ‘TCFD for Net Zero’ perhaps, the <strong>Net Zero Investment Framework (NZIF)</strong> provides the first-ever practical blueprint for investors to enable them to maximise the contribution they make in tackling climate change in order to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.&nbsp; While the willingness has always been there, without a practical roadmap, investors faced a considerable challenge in committing to achieving net zero, risking being left behind as countries, cities, and companies push to achieve the Paris Agreement goals.<br><br></div><div>To deliver this roadmap, the IIGCC analysed more than 25 methodologies and tools, with those considered to be “best fit” approaches included in the framework. While these tools already existed, the IIGCC has done crucial work in bringing them together and helping investors understand how to use them in a holistic way.<br><br></div><div>The framework identifies five key components that help define a net zero investment strategy. Specifically, it covers objectives and targets, strategic asset allocation and asset class alignment, alongside policy advocacy, investor engagement activity and governance. It also covers four different asset classes – sovereign bonds, listed equities, credit (corporate fixed income) and real estate.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In a nutshell, NZIF answers the fundamental and urgent question of what a Paris-aligned portfolio actually looks like, challenging investors to <strong>both</strong> decarbonise investment portfolios and increase investment in solutions that will achieve the transition to a lower carbon economy.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>For investors, having this framework in place and a pathway for shifting capital from high carbon to low carbon alternatives is a valuable step forward.<br><br></div><div>Even better, five investors (APG, Brunel, the Church of England Pensions Board, PKA and Phoenix Group) will now put the framework to the test, modelling its impact across the performance of their real-world portfolios which are collectively valued at $1.3 trillion. The results of this analysis will be launched with the final framework, expected before the end of 2020.<br><br></div><div>While this analysis will provide crucial insights into the framework’s application, we strongly encourage TPI members to contribute to the IIGCC’s <a href=""https://www.iigcc.org/resource/net-zero-investment-framework-for-consultation/"">consultation</a> before 25 September in order to fine-tune the framework before its full launch. Your feedback is critical to ensuring that the IIGCC’s initiative fulfils its potential in helping investors reach net zero.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The development of the framework is a big step forward. But now we must ensure that it meets the needs of all investors before completion.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>At TPI, we are thrilled to see our work recognised as one of the key corporate climate action benchmarks. Investors need to play a central role if the world is to limit climate change to below two degrees and we are very proud to be involved in the IIGCC’s Net Zero Investment Framework.<br><br></div><div>--<br><br></div><div><em>David Russell is Head of Responsible Investment at USS Investment Management Ltd.

Three years ago, for example, no oil and gas company, had set targets to reduce the carbon intensity of the energy they supply. Today all six European oil and gas majors assessed by TPI have set targets and some are now aligned with a path to fulfilling the pledges made at the Paris Agreement. Much of this progress is a result of engagement by Climate Action 100+ members, using TPI data to benchmark company performance. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; <br> We are grateful for the support of our <a href=""https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/tpi/strategic-relationships"">strategic partners</a> LSE, FTSE Russel and PRI and <a href=""about:blank"">investor supporters</a>, who have all committed to using TPI data in their investment activity.

"33","Blackrock’s declaration of intent, emboldens climate action","<div><em>Nadine Viel Lamare</em></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>When BlackRock sneezes, the high carbon economy catches cold. That at least is the hope sparked by the news last month that the world’s largest asset manager had signed up to the Climate Action 100+ initiative as part of its intention to “place sustainability at the centre of our investment approach”.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In two letters, to shareholders and to clients, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink asserted the belief not only that anthropogenic climate is happening but that the financial sector must and will undergo significant structural change to meet this challenge. Naturally, if financial markets are going to change, with the transition to a low carbon economy at the heart of this transformation, it is BlackRock’s fiduciary duty to ensure its investors are best placed to benefit from this.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Since 2020 is likely to be a critical point in averting the worst excesses of climate change, this news is very welcome. In the build-up to COP26 this November, five years since the Paris Agreement set a goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees, action is urgently needed.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>CA100+ becomes biggest game in town</strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The addition of BlackRock to its investor signatories has reinforced the idea CA100+ is now the most important global shareholder engagement initiative on climate.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>CA100+ is an investor initiative that coordinates engagement with the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitters. Signatories commit to working with the 100 systemically important emitters that account for two-thirds of annual global industrial emissions, alongside more than 60 others with a significant opportunity to drive the clean energy transition.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>TPI is a key partner of CA100+, providing data to help CA100+ members accurately assesses whether high-emitting companies are aligning with a path to achieving the Paris Agreement. And to use this data as a basis for engagement.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>For example through our partnership with CA100+, TPI directly supported the engagement with Royal Dutch Shell in 2018 that resulted in the firm’s commitment to set long-term emissions reduction targets, including Scope 3 emissions (indirect emissions in the value chain). In its <a href=""https://www.shell.com/media/news-and-media-releases/2018/joint-statement-between-institutional-investors-on-behalf-of-climate-action-and-shell.html"">joint statement</a> between Shell and Climate Action 100+ investors, the company cited that it will continue to work with TPI as way to assess progress.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Nudge power</strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>There is much still to do. <a href=""https://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/tpi/publications/36.pdf?type=Publication"">TPI’s State of Transition report</a> last year found that only 1 in 8 companies (12.5%) in the highest emitting sectors are reducing carbon emissions at the rate required to keep global warming below 2°C.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>But BlackRock’s announcement will help in this challenge. Although just a fraction of BlackRock’s $7 trillion is subject to discretionary investment decisions, it has significant ‘nudge’ power to encourage investors, for example, to reallocate from the conventional index funds to the sustainable index funds it intends to launch. Funds that may choose to use TPI data to inform them.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>As an index manager, BlackRock will continue to be a major shareholder in many significant greenhouse gas emitters, including those who have stubbornly refused to engage with the reality of the climate catastrophe. Indeed BlackRock itself has previously been criticised for opposing shareholder motions calling for more disclosure on emissions and transition planning.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>BlackRock’s declaration of intent is very welcome and in signing up to CA100+, BlackRock is committing to a new level of engagement for itself. Although many commentators have noted the wording in Mr Fink’s letter only says “we will be increasingly disposed” to vote against management and board directors not making sufficient progress on sustainability-related disclosures and practices. &nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The announcement can certainly embolden CA100+ in its work. We face a challenging future, but with the world’s biggest asset manager moving in the right direction, we have a better chance of aligning the global economy with a world that remains below 2°C&nbsp; of warming.</div>",,"State of Transition","2020-02-07 00:00:00 UTC"

But they are not going fast enough. The message for the world’s airline, automotive and shipping giants from both the UN climate talks and today’s TPI research is very clear: As the low carbon transition ratchets up in 2020 the transport sector risks being left behind. Among 22 large car makers, only two are on track to keep global warming to 2°C or below, so the rest must accelerate their climate action to meet the demands of climate-conscious investors.”<br></em><br></div><div><strong>Adam Matthews</strong>, <strong>Co-Chair of TPI</strong> and <strong>Director of Ethics &amp; Engagement at Church of England Pensions Board </strong>added<strong>:<br></strong><br></div><div><em>“Investors will be troubled by stalled climate progress in aviation, and by the sector’s reliance on net emissions targets.

Nine of the 21 automotive companies (43%) for which TPI has trend data improved their climate Management Quality score this year.

This is a 12% improvement on last year’s assessment. Indeed, the average fleet emissions intensity is currently falling at a rate of 2-2.5% per year based on 2016-2018 data.&nbsp;</li><li>Only two car companies (Daimler &amp; Tesla) are projected to align with a path to keep global warming to 2°C or below.</li></ul><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>Airlines<br></strong><br></div><ul><li>The average climate Management Quality score of airlines has improved by over 8% since Spring 2019; but the airline sector’s Carbon Performance remains the second worst in the TPI database, ahead of only oil &amp; gas in terms of alignment with Paris benchmarks by 2030.</li><li>Almost <strong>60%</strong> of the 22 airlines assessed have emissions-reduction targets that align with the Paris Pledges in 2020. However, beyond 2020 most airline targets are based on net emissions, including offsetting. TPI discounts these net emissions targets due to the uncertainty in quantifying them. (A recent European Commission<a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/clima/sites/clima/files/ets/docs/clean_dev_mechanism_en.pdf""> study</a> of carbon offsets found that 85% of the offset projects under the UN’s Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) failed in the objective of reducing emissions).&nbsp;</li><li>As these net targets are discounted, only two airlines (Easyjet and Wizz Air) are aligned with any of the benchmarks by 2030.

The IEA has made it clear that airlines’ own operational emissions must fall in order to achieve climate targets, so reduction strategies that rely too heavily on offsetting are not credible.

TPI’s assessment finds that corporate boards in the transport sector are showing an increased level of awareness. But it is also clear that more decisive action is needed to align their long-term strategy to a low-carbon future. This is particularly the case for road transportation, where technical solutions are available, but only two out of 22 car manufacturers have aligned their strategies with a 2 degrees or below scenario. This exposes investors to significant financial risk, since regulators are increasingly adopting policies supporting the shift towards cleaner transportation. This research identifies areas where constructive investor engagement can strengthen companies’ commitments”.</em></div><div><strong><br>&nbsp;<br>Notes to editor<br></strong><br></div><div>For more information or exclusive interviews with the TPI team please contact:<strong><br> Eleanor Kilbride, ESG Communications | t: +44 (0)</strong> <strong>7561 594157</strong> <strong>| e: </strong><a href=""mailto:ellie@esgcomms.com""><strong>ellie@esgcomms.com</strong></a><strong><br> <br>The full transport sector analysis report is available on request</strong>.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The TPI research studied the Management Quality and Carbon Performance of 22 automotive manufacturers, 22 airlines, and 13 shipping companies.
