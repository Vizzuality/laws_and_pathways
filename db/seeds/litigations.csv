Bundesminister (European Court of Justice, 2016)","Administrative Case","EUR","European Union","EUR","European Union",,"[2016] Case C-191/14","This European Court of Justice rejected arguments from three industrial firms—one German, one Dutch, and one Italian—that they should be granted a larger number of free greenhouse gas emissions allowances under the European Union’s greenhouse gas Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The Court also instructed the European Commission to revise its approach to determining how many free allowances to grant—a step that has injected uncertainty into the markets built on the ETS. Several features of the ETS are critical to the case: 

some allowances are auctioned to emitters and others are given away for free; 
there are a fixed proportion of free allowances, which are granted only to firms that face competition from non-EU firms—a category that excludes electricity generators;
the process for calculating the number of allowances—auctioned and free—begins with member states’ submission of emission sources and estimated volumes;
responding to members states’ overestimation of the allowances due to their industrial firms, the European Commission issued Decisions in 2011 and 2013 to govern the calculation of a “correction factor.”

The Court found that the European Commission’s 2013 Decision established a “correction factor” calculation that ignored relevant information, and on that basis instructed the Commission to revise its approach by March 2017. The Court’s ruling largely ratified the November 2015 recommendation issued in the case by Advocate General Kokott, but deviated in one important respect: whereas Kokott had concluded that too many free allowances were granted to the firms, the ECJ determined that it was unclear whether too many or too few had been granted.",,"Legal validity of “correction factor” calculation for emissions allowances","Draft",

Nordzucker AG (European  Court of Justice, 2015)","Administrative Case","EUR","European Union","EUR","European Union",,"[2015] Case C-148/14","Nordzucker AG (“Nordzucker”), a sugar refinery operator in Germany, produced an emissions report for 2005 pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC,  part of the European Union’s greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. Nordzucker’s emissions report excluded emissions resulting from steam generation necessary to operate the refinery’s drying facility on the basis of a letter from a German Ministry stating that such facilities were exempted from compulsory emissions trading schemes. An expert verified the report, and Nordzucker surrendered emissions allowances equal to the emissions stated in the report. Subsequently, the German Emissions Trading Authority examined Nordzucker’s emissions report and found that it should have included emissions attributable to the refinery’s drying facility. Nordzucker revised its emissions report and surrendered additional allowances. German authorities found Nordzucker liable for failing to timely surrender emissions allowances and levied a penalty as provided in Article 16(3) of Directive 2003/87. After a series of appeals, the German Federal Administrative Court referred to the European Court of Justice the question whether excess emissions penalties apply where an operator surrenders allowances equal to emissions stated in a verified report, but where the report is later found to understate the operator’s emissions and additional allowances are surrendered. The European Court of Justice found that such penalties should not apply and that, in such cases, national authorities should establish proportionate penalties taking into account relevant factual circumstances.",,"Referred question regarding proper penalties to be levied for excess emissions under EU’s GHG emissions trading scheme","Draft",

The referring court also asked whether national legislators are constrained by an EU concept of what constitutes dual use if they choose to introduce domestic measures in order to tax such energy products. 

The Advocate General answered that ‘dual use’ within the meaning of Article 2(4)(b) refers to where coal is used as heating fuel in a lime-kiln in order to generate carbon dioxide for the production of lime-kiln gas, which is subsequently used for the purification of the raw juice obtained from sugar beets, that process giving rise to the by-product earth foam. The Advocate General found that Member States may apply a more restrictive definition of dual use and choose to tax dual use energy products, provided they exercise their competence consistently with EU law. If a Member State chooses to apply such a narrower definition, a taxpayer cannot invoke a broader EU concept of dual use in order to obtain exoneration from a charge to tax imposed under national law.",,"Requesting guidance as to the meaning of the term ‘dual use’ in Directive 2003/96/EC","Draft",

In this case, the NGT did both: no party brought the case and the NGT ordered authorities in Himachal Pradesh to undertake several measures to remediate various environmental harms identified by consulting experts engaged by the NGT. The fundamental legal basis for the NGT’s decision is India’s constitution, and article 21 in particular, which, the NGT explained, has been interpreted by statutes and judicial decisions as providing for a fundamental right to what the NGT calls a “wholesome, clean, decent environment.” The NGT concluded that the government of Himachal Pradesh had violated its obligations under article 21 (as well as articles 48A and 51A) by failing to restrict development and road and pedestrian traffic in and around the increasingly touristed area accessible via the Rohatang Pass. Melting of regional glaciers and deforestation led the list of environmental impacts noted by the NGT, which identified the emission of black carbon from vehicle traffic as a chief cause of the melting. The NGT drew two linkages between these findings and global warming: first, that global warming heightens the need to take protective measures of a region sensitive to emissions and deforestation; and second, that “there is a need to tackle global warming” in order to avert the sort of environmental degradation at issue in the case. Although the NGT described how greenhouse gas emissions cause global warming, and affirmed the applicability of the “polluter pays” principle to the respondents in this case, the NGT did not assign Himachal Pradesh responsibility for mitigating global warming per se. It did, however, order the government of Himachal Pradesh to impose a host of restrictions on traffic and to undertake a program of reforestation, both of which would be overseen by a Monitoring Committee that would make quarterly reports to the NGT.",,"Challenge to approval given by Minister for Planning for construction proposal on grounds that procedure did not follow Environmental Planning and Assessment Act","Draft",

Bord Na Móna Allen Peat Limited and others engaged in peat extraction and transport were also parties to the case.  At issue was whether the approval granted to Edenderry had complied with the EU’s Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which was incorporated into Irish law in 2010. An Taisce argued that the approval had not because it had considered only the impacts of the plant’s operations but not those resulting from the peat extraction and transport involved in supplying the bulk of the plant’s feedstock. Edenderry and the other respondents countered that because neither the peat nor plant operations were contingent upon one another they were unrelated for the purposes of environmental review. The High Court, noting that it was required to base its decision on the “actual reality of the project” at issue, rejected Edenderry’s arguments as theoretical—the permit application, after all, contemplated sourcing from these particular bogs, such that any other approach would constitute a material change to the application. Thus, “[t]here is functional interdependence as the power plant relies for the vast majority of its raw material on the designated bogs.” The court also noted that it made no difference that the bogs were independently subject to an air pollution licensing regime. The planning authority, it explained, “is entitled to take the licenses into account” when assessing the impacts of the peat extraction operations.",,"Appeal of planning authority grant of permission to operate power plant without first considering impacts of extracting feedstock","Draft",

149,"Thomson v. Minister for Climate Change Issues (High Court of New Zealand, Wellington, filed 10 Nov. 2015)","Administrative Case","NZL","New Zealand","NZL","New Zealand",,"CIV-2015-__","Sarah Thomson, a New Zealand law student, filed a Statement of Claim in 2015 against New Zealand’s Minister of Climate Change Issues alleging that the Minister had failed in several respects regarding the setting of greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets required by New Zealand’s Climate Change Response Act of 2002. That Act implements New Zealand’s responsibilities as a ratifying Annex I member of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It requires the Minister to set an emissions reduction target in keeping with the statements of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and to consider whether to revise that target as the IPCC issues updated findings. In March 2011, pursuant to the 2002 Act, the Minister had set a target of 50% reduction from 1990 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions levels by 2050. The Minister did not review or revise that target following the 2014 issuance of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report. In July 2015, in advance of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Paris, the Minister submitted New Zealand’s intended nationally determined contribution (INDC)--and then subsequently a nationally determined contribution (NDC)--consistent with a “provisional target” of only 30% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030. As Thomson's Statement of Claim noted, “this equates to a reduction of 11% below New Zealand’s 1990 emission levels by 2030,” and thus “will not, if adopted by other developed countries in combination with appropriate targets set by developing countries, stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” Thus Thompson challenged both the target set pursuant to the 2002 law and the target set as part of New Zealand's NDC pursuant to the United National Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, both ratified by New Zealand. The High Court of New Zealand issued its decision after the 2017 election had ousted the prior government, replacing it with a government whose members had campaigned on a commitment to eliminate all GHG emissions by 2050.

Nonetheless, the court reviewed both the 2030 and 2050 targets set by the prior government's Minister and ruled on their legality. With respect to the 2050 target, the court determined that although the Minister had discretion under the 2002 act to review and determine New Zealand's emissions reduction target for 2050, that discretion was limited by the act's purpose and by the evidence contained in IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), both of which argued strongly for a lower national emissions target than the one set based on the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). However, because it was not clear that a review of the 2050 target in light of AR5 would certainly have led to the target's revision, and because the question was largely mooted by the recent election (""[s]uch a declaration would now be of historic interest only""), the court concluded merely that the Minister should have reviewed the target, but not that a decision to maintain the existing target after such a review would necessarily have been unlawful. With respect to the 2030 target in New Zealand's INDC and NDC, the court determined that it had authority to review the Minister's setting of that target but no grounds for invalidating it because the Minister had not made “any reviewable error for which the Court may intervene.” Regarding the authority of the courts to review climate change policy, the decision noted: ""It may be appropriate for domestic courts to play a role in Government decision making about climate change policy . . . The courts have not considered the entire subject matter is a “no go” area, whether because the state had entered into international obligations, or because the problem is a global one and one country’s efforts alone cannot prevent harm to that country’s people and their environment, or because the Government’s response involves the weighing of social, economic and political factors, or because of the complexity of the science. The courts have recognised the significance of the issue for the planet and its inhabitants and that those within the court’s jurisdiction are necessarily amongst all who are affected by inadequate efforts to respond to climate change. The various domestic courts have held they have a proper role to play in Government decision making on this topic, while emphasising that there are constitutional limits in how far that role may extend. The IPCC reports provide a factual basis on which decisions can be made. Remedies are fashioned to ensure appropriate action is taken while leaving the policy choices about the content of that action to the appropriate state body.""",,"Challenge to Minister’s target for GHG emissions reductions","Draft",

<td width=""121"">Greenpeace Southeast Asia and numerous other organizations and individuals filed a petition asking the Commission to investigate a general issue—“the human rights implications of climate change and ocean acidification and the resulting rights violations in the Philippines”—and a more specific one—“whether the investor-owned Carbon Majors have breached their responsibilities to respect the rights of the Filipino people.” The core factual allegation of the petition draws on research identifying particular entities’ quantum of responsibility for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions since 1751. The original petition names 50 of those entities, all publicly traded corporations, as respondents. It identifies multiple sources of human rights, but draws most heavily on the UN Human Rights Commission’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

During a conference held on December 11, 2017, the Commission accepted the petition and confirmed that they would investigate the potential human rights violations stemming from major fossil fuel companies’ contributions to climate change. The Commission announced it would hold fact-finding missions and public hearings in 2018. In March 2018, the Commission held its first public hearings to investigate the alleged responsibility of major fossil fuel companies or “carbon majors” for climate change and the potential impacts on the human rights of Filipinos.</td>

Swiss Federal Council and Others","Administrative Case","CHE","Switzerland","CHE","Switzerland",,"No. A-2992/2017","In 2016, a group of senior women, filed suit against the Swiss Government, alleging that the government had failed to uphold obligations under the Swiss Constitution and European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) by not steering Switzerland onto an emissions reduction trajectory consistent with the goal of keeping global temperatures below 2ºC above pre-industrial levels/ Specifically, petitioners alleged the government had violated articles 10 (right to life), 73 (sustainability principle), and 74 (precautionary principle) of the Swiss Constitution and by articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The women’s petition noted that their demographic group is especially vulnerable to the heat waves expected to result from climate change. It asked that the legislature and the federal agencies responsible for transportation, environmental protection, and energy be required to develop a regulatory approach to several sectors that would achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions of at least 25% below 1990 levels by 2020 and at least 50% below 1990 levels by 2050. It criticized both the targets currently under discussion in the legislature (20% by 2020 and 30% by 2030) and the measures by which the Government would pursue those targets.

This petition was dismissed by the Department of Environment, Transport, Energy, and Communications (DETEC) on April 25, 2017. DETEC found petitioners lacked standing because their rights were not affected as necessary under Article 25a (1) APA (Administrative Procedure Act, Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz,VwVG). DETEC determined that petitioners sought regulation of global CO2 emissions through general regulations rather than seeking a remedy for an infringement of their specific legal rights. They similarly found that petitioners did not have victim status under the ECHR because they sought a solution to serve the wider public interest of adoption of legislative reform to reduce CO2 emissions. Petitioners appealed the dismissal on May 26, 2017.

On November 27, 2018, the Swiss Federal Administrative Court dismissed the case on the basis that Swiss women over 75 years of age are not the only population affected by climate change impacts, echoing DETEC’s determination that the injury and remedy were not specialized to petitioners. The judgment has been appealed to the Swiss Supreme Court.",,"Adequacy of Swiss government's climate change mitigation targets and implementation measures","Draft",

<td class=""xl66"" width=""121"" height=""20"">A Dutch environmental group, the Urgenda Foundation, and 900 Dutch citizens sued the Dutch government to require it to do more to prevent global climate change. The court in the Hague ordered the Dutch state to limit GHG emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, finding the government’s existing pledge to reduce emissions 17% insufficient to meet the state’s fair contribution toward the UN goal of keeping global temperature increases within two degrees Celsius of pre-industrial conditions. The court concluded that the state has a duty to take climate change mitigation measures due to the “severity of the consequences of climate change and the great risk of climate change occurring.” In reaching this conclusion, the court cited (without directly applying) Article 21 of the Dutch Constitution; EU emissions reduction targets; principles under the European Convention on Human Rights; the “no harm” principle of international law; the doctrine of hazardous negligence; the principle of fairness, the precautionary principle, and the sustainability principle embodied in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; and the principle of a high protection level, the precautionary principle, and the prevention principle embodied in the European climate policy. The court did not specify how the government should meet the reduction mandate, but offered several suggestions, including emissions trading or tax measures. This is the first decision by any court in the world ordering states to limit greenhouse gas emissions for reasons other than statutory mandates.

The Dutch government submitted 29 grounds of appeal. Urgenda submitted a cross-appeal, contesting the court’s decision that Urgenda cannot directly invoke Articles 2 & 8 of the ECHR in these proceedings.

On Oct 9, 2018, the Hague Court of Appeal upheld the District Court's ruling, concluding that by failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 25% by end-2020, the Dutch government is acting unlawfully in contravention of its duty of care under Articles 2 and 8 of the ECHR. The court recognized Urgenda’s claim under Article 2 of the ECHR, which protects a right to life, and Article 8 of the ECHR, which protects the right to private life, family life, home, and correspondence. The court determined that the Dutch government has an obligation under the ECHR to protect these rights from the real threat of climate change. The court rejected the government’s argument that the lower court decision constitutes “an order to create legislation” or violation of trias politica and the role of courts under the Dutch constitution. In response to these appeals, the court affirms its obligation to apply provisions with direct effect of treaties to which the Netherlands is party, including Articles 2 and 8 of the ECHR. Further, the court found nothing in Article 193 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union that prohibits a member state from taking more ambitious climate action than the E.U. as a whole, nor that adaptation measures can compensate for the government’s duty of care to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, nor that the global nature of the problem excuses the Dutch government from action.</td>

The court stated that Parliament had deliberately not decided the offense of cheating the revenue. Parliament had left the offense of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue from statutory charge, both in existence and the penalty at large, because it is of particular seriousness. In assessing whether or not the sentences were manifestly excessive, the court looked at previous decisions of the court and the draft guideline from the Sentencing Council, and noted that: cheating the revenue is a major drain on the public purse, and the defendants’ actions were a serious level of offending, with an enormous amount of planning.

Greenpeace challenged that decision arguing that the consultation process had been flawed. Agreeing with Greenpeace’s allegations, the High Court declared the consultation process to have been “very seriously flawed” (para. 116). Notably, the Court reminded the Secretary of State that the Government had signed and ratified the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters and was thus bound by international law to provide full public consultation. Among other shortfalls, the Court highlighted that insufficient information was given to consultees, that the consultation document was seriously misleading, and that the consultation period was insufficient.

In arriving at its decision, the Court acknowledged the appellants' argument that burning cane does not add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere on a net basis over a multi-year timeframe, because it only releases gases absorbed by the cane over the prior 12-18 months.

72,"Jan Chetna v. Ministry of Environment & Forests","Administrative Case","IND","India","IND","India",,"Appeal No. 22 of 2011(T)","M/s. Scania Steels & Power Ltd. (formerly known as Sidhi Vinayak Sponge Iron Ltd.) was operating a Sponge Iron Plant in Village Punjipatra, Tehsil Gharghoda, District Raigarh in the State of Chhattisgarh, before 2004 i.e. prior to issuance of Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification, 2006. The production capacity of the said existing unit was 66,000 TPA of Sponge Iron (2 x 100 TPD kilns). In the year, 2008, M/s Scania Steels & Power Ltd. (hereinafter called as Scania for the sake of brevity) applied to the Ministry of Environment and Forest (in short MoEF) for expansion of the existing project. It proposed to enhance the production of Sponge Iron from 66,000 TPA to 1,32,000 TPA by adding another unit or 66,000 TPA, install a Steel Melting Shop (Induction Furnace, 3x15 tons) with CCM facility of 1,35,000 TPA capacity, a Ferro Alloy Plant (5MVA) of 7,5000 TPA and Captive Power Plant of 25 MW, (AFBC 17 MW + WHRB 8 MW). The proposal was considered by the MoEF and environment clearance (in short EC) was granted by letter dated 5th November, 2008 for the proposed expansion.

Jan Chetna (Appellant No.1) claiming to be a social and environmental group formed with the objective of working for the welfare of the local communities and creating awareness on social and environmental issues, represented through one or its Member Shri Ramesh Agrawal, and Shri Rajesh Tripathi claiming to be a Project affected person, having agriculture land adjacent to the project site and also claiming to be a social activist and a member of Jan Chetna, assailed the order dated 5th November, 2008, passed by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) granting EC for expansion of the project in question before the then National Environment Appellate Authority (NEAA). The NEAA dismissed the Appeal. The said order was assailed by the present Appellant before the High Court of Delhi in WPC No.11157 of 2009, which set aside the order passed by NEAA and directed the said Authority to dispose of the Appeal on merits, as expeditiously as possible. While NEAA was in session of the case, The NGT Act was promulgated and in consonance with the provisions of the said Act, the Appeal stood transferred to this Tribunal. 
The learned judges heard the counsel for the parties at length; perused the pleadings, documents annexed by the parties and notes of submissions, meticulously; and considered the submissions of all the Learned Counsel diligently. The controversies involved in this Appeal are as follows:-

i) Whether the Appellants have locus-standi to prefer the Appeal and assail the EC granted in favour of M/s. Scania Steels & Power Ltd. (Respondent No. 3)?
ii) Whether the proposal submitted to enhance the production of existing Sponge Iron Unit from 66,000 TPA to further 66,000 TPA by installing a new unit, setting up a Steel Melting Shop with CCM facility of 1,35,000 TPA capacity, a Ferro Alloy Plant of 7,500 TPA and Captive Power Plant of 25 MW, would amount to expansion of the existing Sponge Iron Plant of 66,000 TPA established prior to 2004 or amounts to installing new projects?
iii) As to whether the proposal satisfies the requirement of Clause-7(ii) of EIA Notification, 2006 and Public Hearing / consultation can be exempted?
iv) Whether the Authorities have duly applied their mind to the facts and circumstances, the scientific data and other particulars submitted by the Project Proponent, and the decision taken to grant EC was justified or proper?

Before entering into the area of controversy, the learned judges recapitulate the principles relating to Industrial Development vis-à-vis sustainable development. It is now well settled by a series of judgments of the Supreme Court that though the industrial development is of vital importance to the country as it generates foreign exchange and provides employment avenues, it has no right to destroy the ecology, degrade the environment and pose health hazards. In view of the constitutional and statutory provisions (as mentioned in the original judgement), the Court held that “Precautionary Principle” and the “Polluter Pays Principle” are part of the environment law of the country.

The expression “aggrieved persons” cannot be considered in a restricted manner. The Tribunal has no hesitation to hold that that the Appellants satisfy the definition of “Person aggrieved” and they have locus-standi to file this Appeal. 

A cumulative reading of the provisions of EIA Notifications, 2006 in the touch stone of the principles laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme court in different decisions, gives an impression that public consultations as incorporated in 2006 Notification is in recognition and in furtherance of the rights to the environment. Public consultations ordinarily have two components; (i) public hearing at the site or in its close proximity and (ii) to obtain responses in writing from other concerned persons having a plausible stake in the environmental aspects of the project or activity.

The wording of Clause 7(ii) is very clear and is bereft of any ambiguity. It stipulates that all applications seeking prior environmental clearance for expansion, with increase in the production capacity beyond the capacity for which Prior Environmental Clearance has been granted under this Notification, or with increase either in lease area or production capacity etc. etc., would attract the exclusion of Public consultation. In the case in hand, the production capacity of an existing Sponge Iron Unit is sought to be enhanced, and its production capacity increased, but then no environmental clearance has been granted to the said existing Sponge Iron Unit, under EIA Notification, 2006, thus the concession not to hold public consultation cannot be extended to the expansion of the existing Sponge Iron Unit. Furthermore, all the proposed units being interlinked and dependent on one another, and as no unit can be established in the absence of the other, the learned judges are of the view that the decision taken to exempt Public Consultation to the entire project under Clause 7(ii) of the EIA Notification, 2006, was not just and proper specially due to significant increase in pollution load and consequential environmental ramifications. Considering the magnitude of the proposed project, they further feel that the public in general should have given an opportunity of putting forth their views with regard to the projects.

In view of the infirmities noticed during the course of hearing, the MoEF is directed to develop appropriate mechanism, to check the authenticity of environmental data reported in the EIA/EMP report which would facilitate a more realistic environmental appraisal of project. Steps should also be taken for black listing Consultants found to have reported “cooked data” or “wrong data” and for producing sub-standard EIA/EMP report. 

Strict reading of Clause 7(ii) of EIA Notification, 2006 clearly provides power to EAC or State Level EAC to decide on due diligence necessary including preparation of EIA and Public Consultations only for those expansion proposals or modernization of existing units, which were accorded prior environmental clearance, under this Notification (EIA Notification, 2006). In the present case, as has been held, neither exemption from Public Consultation is applicable under expansion category nor under modernization pretext as the expansion proposal of M/s Scania Steel and Power Ltd., which is an existing Sponge Iron Plant, was not accorded prior environmental clearance under the EIA Notification, 2006. It also does not satisfy the category of modernization of the existing unit, as a number of new facilities such as Induction Furnace, Ferro Allow Plant and Captive Power Plant have been proposed to be added which would certainly result in additional pollution load in the area. The legislators, while framing Clause 7(ii) of EIA Notification, 2006, might have kept in mind that if Public Consultation has already been done earlier under EIA Notification, 2006 while giving prior EC, the same Public Hearing (in short PH) need not be required again at the time of expansion or modernization of unit.

Only because, the authorities have exempted Public Consultation in respect of some other projects, cannot be ground for exempting the same so far as Scania is concerned. Law is well settled that each case has to be determined and decided in consonance with the facts and circumstances relating to the said case and there cannot be a universal decision to either conduct or exempt public hearing while granting EC.
In view of the discussions made in the preceding paragraphs, the MoEF is directed to get public consultation (Public Hearing) conducted for the proposed projects at the site or nearby area of the site as per the provisions contained in the EIA Notification, 2006. This direction is necessary in order to achieve the object and purpose of the Notification 31 vis-a-vis the Statute. Till the aforesaid exercise is completed, the EC granted on 5th November, 2008 for the proposed expansion of Integrated Steel Plant and Captive Power Plant at Village Kunjipatra, District Raigarh, Chhattisgarh by M/s. Scania Steel and Power Limited, shall remain suspended. It is needless to say that the MoEF shall take prompt steps for completing the exercise of public consultation (Public Hearing) and curing the deficiency in EIA/EMP, and re-visit the entire project in the light of the observations made by this Tribunal and complete the entire exercise as expeditiously as possible. It is needless to be said that the EC granted would be subject to the decision to be taken by the MoEF after public consultation, and other directions.

Union of India","Administrative Case","IND","India","IND","India",,"Application No. 10/2013(THC) (WZ)","The Applicants filed Writ Petition in the High Court of Judicature of Bombay Bench at Aurangabad, alleging that certain forest lands were being illegally diverted for non-forest purposes, which would cause felling of trees to the extent of 2.5 to 3 lakhs and that would be a great loss to the environment. By order dated October 1st, 2003, Division Bench of the High Court, transferred the Writ Petition to this Tribunal in view of Judgment of the Apex Court in the case of “Bhopal Gas Peedith Mahila Udyog Sangathan & Anr Vs Union of India” (2012) 8, SCC 326. The case of the Applicants, as can be gathered from the pleadings of the Writ Petition, is that there are ten projects as stated in the petition, which are Irrigation Projects of large scale, minor scale, Percolation Tank etc. For the purpose of these irrigation projects, the Respondents have planned to divert forest area, without taking due Forest Clearance (FC) from the competent Authority. They are likely to cut down large number of trees in the range of 2.5 to 3 lakhs, which will cause severe environmental damage. The Applicants further allege that some part of Yawal sanctuary is likely to be submerged in irrigation project called “Handya-Kundya”Project, which will affect the wildlife in the said sanctuary. So also, it will affect Teak wood and Bamboo trees within the area of said sanctuary.

The Respondent Nos.2 to 6 (2.The State of Maharashtra, 3. The Chief Conservator of Forests, Seminary hills, Nagpur, 4. The Conservator of Forests, Dist. Dhule, 5. The Deputy Conservator of Forests, Jalgaon Division 6, The Deputy Conservator of Forests, Yawal Division), resisted the petition on various grounds. According to them, total land covered by the said ten projects is 6,394.18 Ha. All the projects are for public welfare and the cost benefit ratio is more than the loss of number of trees, which is estimated during the study that was undertaken before planning of the projects. They submit that by way of compensation equal area of non- forest land was received and shall be utilized for afforestation. They further submit that they will plant large number of trees over the available land of 1423.8 Ha. The felling of trees is 133179, whereas 2562966 seedlings are sought to be planted. The project will solve the water scarcity problem faced by the local public members. It will also cause benefit to the Agriculturists, because irrigation facility will be available to them for irrigation of their lands. It is denied that wildlife is likely to be disturbed due to the projects or any part thereof.

After hearing the matter, the Tribunal gave the following directions:
• The Respondent Nos.2 to 6 shall monitor plantation of adequate number of trees, as far as possible of 1:8 ratio and make serious endeavor to protect the plants to improve survival rate of the trees.

• The projects shall be implemented peri pasu with the process of plantation, proper maintenance, rearing, monitoring, watering and protecting of plants, to ensure that when the projects are completed, the plants will be transformed as trees.

68,"Sarang Yadwadkar v. Pune Municipal Corporation","Administrative Case","IND","India","IND","India",,"Application no. 02 of 2013","The applicants challenge the construction of the road from Vitthalwadi to National Highway-4 bypass, which is being constructed under the Draft Development Plan on the ground that the Draft Development Plan has not been approved by the State Government, no permission from Irrigation Department has been taken and the road touches the Vitthalwadi Temple and its surrounding areas which are Grade I Heritage Buildings and even permission from Archaeological Department has not been taken. This construction, according to the applicants, is bound to cause massive environmental, ecological and social damage. The construction of the road is being carried out in the river bed i.e. within the “blue line”. Thus, the applicants pray that the on-going construction work should be stopped immediately and the respondents; any other person or agencies should be restrained from dumping any debris or construction material; the entire debris and soil dumping should be directed to be removed and finally the boundaries of the river should be expressly defined and marked by the local government in conjunction with Irrigation Department and the Archaeological Department.

According to a new Draft Development Plan, Vithalwadi was included in the Pune Municipal Corporation. The Construction is part of the new Draft Development Plan.

According to the applicants, the Respondents (Pune Municipal Corporation) are constructing the road within the Mutha river bed itself and have elevated the level of the road by 20 ft. to 30 ft. by way of illegal dumping rubble and earth and tens of thousands of truckloads of debris and soil are dumped right in the river bed for elevating the road. As a result, there has been reduction of the width of the river Mutha by about 55% and it is bound to result in increased floods in the surrounding densely populated residential areas during rainy season.

The applicants, have raised two specific grounds – one that the road is being constructed by the respondents into the river bed (i.e. blue line) and secondly huge dumping of debris have caused destruction of the riparian zone along the Mutha river.

The Respondents have put forth the reasons for the construction of the road: (i) Serve a public purpose of reducing traffic congestion on Sinhagad Road, (ii) Save the Dam, (iii) Reduce fuel consumption, and (iv)Consequently reduce vehicular pollution. In nutshell, it was going to serve a public purpose. According to them, the environment and ecology is going to benefit from this Road. 

The Tribunal is therefore expected to derive a balance between the apprehended environmental and ecological damage on the one hand and the need for construction of the road with its economic advantages on the other. Keeping in mind the public interest, that by imposition of certain conditions, environmental and ecological interests can be safeguarded, The Tribunal permitted Respondents to complete the project. Accordingly, the following conditions were imposed subject to which the project could continue:

(a) Respondents would be permitted to carry out and complete the project of building only 24 metre wide road from Vitthalwadi to NH-4 bypass as strictly and subject to the conditions stated hereinafter.
(b) Respondents shall make every effort to realign the road to bring it as far as possible closer to and beyond the blue line. It shall ensure to extend the least part of the project in the river bed/blue line. 
(c) The road/project shall be constructed on elevated pillars alone in the area that falls within the blue line.
(d) Respondent will remove the debris dumped at the present site and shift the same to the red line by following 1 in 25 years rule. 
(e) A massive plantation should be undertaken on both sides of the river, also in the no-development zone by Respondents as well as the State Government of Maharashtra. Adequate protective measures should be undertaken to prevent flooding and submerging of the residential area along the proposed road. 
(f) The conditions imposed by the Chief Engineer, Irrigation Department shall mutatis mutandis be part of the Tribunal’s directions. 
(g) Respondents shall take appropriate steps against unauthorised constructions, if any, raised on and inside the blue line and pass order of demolition or such other order as is permissible in accordance with law. The Tribunal also directed the said authorities to ensure that no encroachment is permitted and no construction in future is permitted on and inside the blue line of the river Mutha. 

If the conditions imposed under this order are found to be onerous by the State, particularly Respondent No.1 (Pune Municipal Corporation), then they can even give up the project on river Mutha as an alternative road on the other side of the river has already been constructed to provide the connectivity. In the event the Department decides to give up the road project, it shall be incumbent on it to remove all debris from within the blue line that has been used to create the high rise road segment. It is stated to be a 100 ft. wide road on the left bank of the river Mutha giving connectivity with the same bypass. Thus, in the present case,

The Environmental Clearance (for short EC) was already granted as early as 22nd August 2007 by the Ministry of Environment and Forest (for short MoEF). It has been more than three years, and the EC has not been challenged so it is valid. Thus, the only challenge made is for the grant of FC and not EC.
Appellant No. 1 is a Gandhian Social Activist working for the Environment Protection and Peoples’ right over the natural resources in middle Himalaya area since 1988. Appellant No. 2 is an economist and a former Professor of Indian Institute of Management, Bangalore and lives on the bank of the river Alaknanda. Appellant No. 3 is a Social Activist and elected as Van Sarpanch of Village Naurakh. All of them are affected by the FC of the Vishnugad-Pipalkoti hydro power project in which construction of a 65m high diversion dam across river Alaknanda at Helong Village, Chamoli district of Uttarakhand State is proposed. 

The total land requirement of the project is about 120 hectares. Out of which, about 40ha is agriculture land and about 80 hectares is government forest land. The grant of FC in the present case was substantially based on the study made by Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee (for short IITR) and Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun (for short WII). As per the scope of work, “effectiveness of mitigative measures and compliance of stipulated conditions on which various projects earlier have been examined”, was to be completed, however, no such study was conducted. Thus, the recommendation of the Forest Advisory Committee (for short FAC) was based on non-existent study and as such is arbitrary and whimsical. The Respondents No. 1 to 3 have filed their detailed relies. According to them, all the allegations made and the grounds raised in the appeal are all baseless and liable to be rejected.

The following questions arise for considerations in this appeal-
a) Whether the appellants can be called as aggrieved and /or injured “person(s)” as defined under the National Green Tribunal (for short NGT) Act and the appeal is maintainable by them:
A reading of Sections 2(j), (i) to (viii) of the National Green Tribunal Act, 2010 would reveal that any individual, Hindu undivided family, Company, Firm, an association of persons or a body of individuals whether incorporated or not, trustees of a trust, a local authority and every artificial juridical person not falling within any of the preceding sub-clauses, would indicate “person” who can maintain an application/appeal under the NGT Act. But, it is the argument of the learned counsel of the Respondent that even the above defined person shall be a person either aggrieved or injured directly or indirectly and not otherwise. The only exception to be made for treating an appeal/application as not maintainable could be a matter which falls beyond the seven (7) Acts as notified in Schedule I of the NGT Act 2010 and in a case of mala-fide and vexatious litigation brought before this Tribunal and not otherwise.

The statutory provisions are subservient to the constitutional mandates. The person as defined or person aggrieved as occurs in Sections 2(j), 16 and 18 (2) of the NGT Act cannot be placed above “every citizen” as appears in Article 51A of the Constitution of India. Once the mandate is of every citizen, any person can approach this Tribunal complaining environmental threat in the activities of the State or any organization or individual.

Therefore, the appellants are interested persons in the environment and ecology of the area, though they are not directly affected/ injured at this point of time. But, they can be definitely called aggrieved persons since they apprehend some danger, if the project is launched without taking proper precautions.
b) Whether the appellants are justified in raising grounds that may be available for challenging the EC or its conditions in the guise of challenging the grant of present FC:

Admittedly, the EC was granted to the project on 22nd August, 2007 and no challenge was made to EC. The FC alone is under challenge in this Appeal. Therefore, the submission made by learned counsel for the appellant that all the issues that arise from the EC can also be raised in this appeal cannot be countenanced and accepted. But an exception can be made when the issues overlap i.e. the issues that were considered at the time of grant of EC and again while granting FC, since they are considered one after the other, independently.

c) Whether the FC granted in favour of project proponent is in consonance with the principles of sustainable development and precautionary measures:

The appellants have raised grounds pertaining to negative impact of tunneling on water springs and its subsequent impact on forests and agriculture; Methane emissions from reservoirs; deterioration in water quality due to less absorption of beneficent chemicals; loss of aesthetic and ‘non-use values’; value of free-flowing rivers; breeding of mosquitoes in reservoirs and the negative impact on health; deprivation of sand and fish to local people; negative cultural impacts; and negative impact of blasting/ tunneling, etc. Whereas the respondents have filed detailed replies countering the allegations and relied on various documents/ reports starting from Environment Impact Assessment/Environment Management Plan report, Geological reports, Appraisal documents for World Bank loan, etc.

The process of analyzing cumulative effects is an enhancement of the traditional EIA components: (i) scoping, (ii) describing the affected environment, and (iii) determining the environmental consequences. The Cumulative Impact Assessment f(or short CIA) studies in the instant case were awarded to IITR & WII separately with elaborate TOR and time bound deliverables as evidenced from the material placed on record. 

With regards to question pertaining to environmental flow, though originally part of EC, it is argued that the MoEF has stipulated at Para (xi) of the FC that minimum environmental flow as recommended in IITR study report shall be released whereas, the environmental flow determined by IITR is erroneous owing to limited data, non-use of Building Block Method and mechanical application of other methodologies as examined by Mr. Himanshu Thakkar and Parineeta Dandekar of South Asian Networks on Dams, Rivers and People. In this context, a study of International Water Management Institute (for short IWMI) has been quoted that gives environmental flow recommendations for the Ganges basin. The learned judges are of the considered opinion that the stipulations regarding environmental flow certainly follow the sustainable development and precautionary principles.

“We are of the opinion that there are no substantial merits calling for our interference into the FC, in question, granted by the Respondent No. 1. “

The appeal stands disposed of subject to the following directions: 
1. Integrated CIA Report preparation: The first respondent shall setup an appropriate committee of experts drawn from IITR and WII in the preparation of CIA report of the five projects considered in WII report to integrate the physical, biological and social impacts in making comprehensive cumulative impact assessment report and frame appropriate conclusions and recommendations within a reasonable timeframe for consideration and final review by the Ministry of Environment and Forest to avoid any unforeseen environmental and ecological threat in the study area. If this direction is not carried out, the appellant is at liberty to take appropriate steps as required under the law.

2. Preparation of Cost Benefit Analysis Norms: Considering the need for better procedures in making sound evaluation of the forest land diversion proposals, following options for cost benefit analysis shall be explored for future proposals:

a. the guidelines for cost benefit analysis may be updated/modified to provide clear instructions regarding the various cost and benefit elements to be incorporated for the purpose of arriving at cost benefit ratio; and
b. the cost benefit analysis for each proposal received for diversion of forest land shall be done adopting the prescribed procedure.",,"Challenge to the construction of a dam.","Draft",

Ministry of Environment & Forests","Administrative Case","IND","India","IND","India",,"Application No. 16/2013(CZ)(Suo Moto)","In the Bhopal edition of daily newspaper ‘Times of India’ dated 10 April 2013, a news item was published on the front page under the caption ""Dolomite mining a threat to Tiger corridor in Kanha - Foresters want ban on mining in Mandla District"". Considering the gravity of the news item suo-motu cognizance was taken by this tribunal and notice was issued to the Respondent Nos. 1 to 6 on 10th April, 2013 with a direction to place on record the particulars of Mining Leases (in short 'ML') mentioned in the news item. In response to the above notice, the Respondent No.5, Madhya Pradesh State Pollution Control Board (in short 'MPPCB') submitted reply dated 29th April, 2013 stating that the officials of the MPPCB inspected the Dolomite mines in Mandla District and monitored the Ambient Air Quality (in short 'AAQ') in different locations where Consent to Operate the mines was granted to 36 ML holders. Out of 36 mines, 26 mines are having valid Consent to Operate and during the inspection, they were found to be under operation. Of the remaining 10 mines for which Consent to operate has expired, it was found that two mines are still under operation which is irregular and eight mines are closed. Therefore, show cause notice was issued for closure of the aforesaid two mines. With regard to AAQ it is reported that the standards are within the permissible limits and no pollution is observed. However, not satisfied with the above reply of the MPPCB, during the hearing of the case on 1 May 2013 this Tribunal directed the MPPCB to furnish full particulars of all the Dolomite mines in Mandla District.
After considering the arguments of both the parties the Tribunal directed that a meeting be convened immediately at the highest level under the chairmanship of the Chief Secretary to the Government of Madhya Pradesh involving the officials of the State Forest Department, National Tiger Conservation Authority, Officer in-charge of Regional Office, MoEF, Bhopal, Principal Secretaries, Environment and Mines and Minerals, Government of Madhya Pradesh, Chairman, State Pollution Control Board, Madhya Pradesh, District Collector, Mandla and examine and take following actions in accordance with law duly fixing a time limit for each of the issues to be taken up and completed with promptitude by the authorities concerned. 
i.) Necessary penal action shall be initiated against those ML holders who were found violating the provisions of Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981 as well as the ML conditions and Forest Act and even revoking their license if repeatedly found violating the provisions of law. 

ii.) Though, ML area of most of the mines is limited and below 5 hectares, they are located in clusters in the limits of discussed 6 villages. Heavy human activity in these clusters involving high concentration of labour, deployment of machinery, movement of trucks to and from the mine sites shall definitely have a cumulative impact. Therefore, it may be examined whether these mines require cumulative Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) study and then only granting EC under cluster approach as envisaged in EIA Notification, 2006 and amendments made therein from time to time and in accordance with guidelines issued by the MoEF from time to time. In the meanwhile, movement of vehicles and mining activities shall be regulated in consultation with the Forest Department to not disturb the wildlife in the area. 

iii.) The reply filed on behalf of the State Govt. functionaries reveal that there is no coordination between the Mining and Forest Departments at least in case of those mines which are located in the Forest area and which are in close proximity to the forest boundary. In the reply filed on behalf of the Respondents No. 2, 3, 4 and 6 it was stated that the local Forest officials have expressed their deep concern pertaining to the mines sanctioned in the Reserved Forest and mine operators are required to obtain transit passes from the Forest Department. It was also stated that the ML conditions are not informed to the Forest Department and the ML holders are also reluctant to provide the information to the Forest Department. There is a need to put full stop to this state of affairs and streamline the entire procedure of sanctioning & operating the mines. The Government should evolve a suitable mechanism to avoid such conflicting situation and ensure coordination among all the law-enforcing authorities in the state. 
iv.) The irregularities pointed in the reply filed by the Regional Office, MoE
F shall be taken up seriously and all the mines found violating the provisions & ML conditions as well as Environmental laws should be dealt with seriously in accordance with law. 
v.) Keeping in view the concern expressed by the NTCA in their affidavit dated 25.02.2014 dealt herein, all the necessary caution needs to be taken before reviewing the existing MLs and granting / renewing EC and also before granting the Consent to Operate the mines. 
vi.) Even though the mines are under operation for a long period, it is surprising to note that such grave irregularities have been noticed only during the inspection of mines by the officials of the Regional Office, MoEF that too after the case was taken up suo motu by this Tribunal and no record was placed before us to the effect that any severe action has been taken against the defaulting ML holders. The Chief Secretary shall get the whole issue enquired and initiate action against the erring officials if it is found that they indulged in dereliction of duty by allowing the mines to continue to operate violating the law. 
vii.) With regard to those mines which are located on the boundary of the notified forest itself the issue may be examined in details and action may be taken to revoke their license in accordance with law, if no such provision of granting MLs touching the notified forest boundary, exists. 

With the above directions, Tribunal disposed of this Application. To ensure compliance of the order, it was directed that the matter be listed in the Court on 31 July 2014.",,"Challenge to the pollution impacts of a mine operation.","Draft",

<td width=""121"">Two environmental NGOs sought a declaratory judgment from the Oslo District Court that Norway’s Ministry of Petroleum and Energy violated the Norwegian constitution by issuing a block of oil and gas licenses for deep-sea extraction from sites in the Barents Sea. Their petition highlighted several key factual points:

-- the licenses would allow access to as-yet undeveloped fossil fuel deposits, and such development is inconsistent with the climate change mitigation required to avert global warming of 1.5°C and possibly even 2°C in excess of pre-industrial levels;
-- the area made accessible by the licenses would be the northernmost yet developed, and would abut the ice zone—thus rigs and tankers would be exposed to unprecedented risks of damage and spills, and their operation would deliver emissions of black carbon to the highly sensitive arctic; and
-- the Norwegian government will incur costs to develop the sites, and will only recoup those costs if the oil and gas they produce commands and adequately high market price.

It situated these points in a legal context shaped most fundamentally by article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution, which establishes a “right to an environment that is conducive to health and to a natural environment whose productivity and diversity are maintained.” Other constitutional provisions cited in the petition as relevant to the licensing decision included those requiring government action to be consistent with: the precautionary principle; the no harm principle as it applies both domestically and to citizens of other countries; and human rights protections.

The Oslo District Court ruled in favor of the Norwegian Government on January 4, 2018. The court recognized that Article 112 of the Constitution is a rights provision, but found that the government did not violate any relevant rights because it had fulfilled the necessary duties before making the licensing decision. The court also declared that, “[e]missions of CO2 abroad from oil and gas exported from Norway are irrelevant when assessing whether the Decision entails a violation of Article 112.” In its assessment of whether the government had fulfilled its duties in regard to tradition environmental harm or other climate effects, the court noted that the Storting, (the Norwegian Parliament), had broadly agreed to open the Barents Sea South-east to licensing and had considered proposals to halt that licensing or review whether it was inappropriate in light of the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. According to the court’s decision, the involvement of the Storting could be found in itself sufficient to indicate that the duty to take measures had been fulfilled.

Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth have filed an appeal of the district court’s decision. Appellants allege that “[t]he District Court erred in interpreting Article 112 in such a way that it limits the duty of the Norwegian government to guarantee the right to a healthy environment.” They argue that the court interpreted Article 112 too restrictively in reaching the determination that Norway is only responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions released within Norwegian territory. A translation of the appeal is forthcoming and will be posted as soon as possible.</td>

RWE","Administrative Case","DEU","Germany","DEU","Germany",,"2 O 285/15","In November 2015, Saúl Luciano Lliuya, a Peruvian farmer who lives in Huaraz, Peru, filed claims for declaratory judgment and damages in a German court against RWE, Germany’s largest electricity producer. Lliuya’s suit alleged that RWE, having knowingly contributed to climate change by emitting substantial volumes of greenhouse gases (GHGs), bore some measure of responsibility for the melting of mountain glaciers near his town of Huaraz, population 120,000. That melting has given rise to an acute threat: Palcacocha, a glacial lake located above Huaraz, has experienced a substantial volumetric increase since 1975, which has accelerated since 2003. Lliuya presented several legal theories in support of his claim, including one that characterized RWE's emissions as a nuisance that Lliuya had incurred compensable costs to mitigate. Acknowledging that RWE was only a contributor to the emissions responsible for climate change and thus for the lake's growth, Lliuya asked the court to order RWE to reimburse him for a portion of the costs he and the Huaraz authorities had incurred to establish flood protections. That portion was 0.47% of the total cost -- the same percentage as Lliuya's estimate of RWE’s annual contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions.

The court dismissed Lliuya’s requests for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as his request for damages. The court noted that it could not provide Lliuya with effective redress (Lliuya's situation would not change, the court said, even if RWE ceased emitting), and that no “linear causal chain” could be discerned amid the complex components of the causal relationship between particular greenhouse gas emissions and particular climate change impacts.

On November 30, 2017, the appeals court recognized the complaint as well-pled and admissible. The case will move forward into the evidentiary phase to determine whether the Lliuya’s home is (a) threatened by flooding or mudslide as a result of the recent increase in the volume of the glacial lake located nearby, and (b) how RWE’s greenhouse gas emissions contribute to that risk. The court will review expert opinion on the RWE’s CO2 emissions, the contribution of those emissions to climate change, the resulting impact on the Palcaraju Glacier, and RWE’s contributory share of responsibility for causing the preceding effects. While the facts of this case must still be adjudicated, the court’s recognition that a private company could potentially be held liable for the climate change related damages of its greenhouse gas emissions marks a significant development in law.",,"Flood risk from climate change","Draft",

In addition, they claimed the legislator disregarded the extent of its competence, and the intelligibility of the law (art. 34 of the Constitution) because he did not provide enough criteria to delimitate part of territories favorable to the development of wind energy. The Constitutional Council rejected the argument of violation of article 34 of the Constitution, and examined only the violation of the public participation principle. The climate, air quality and energy plan, as well as the annexed local wind energy plan, define the objectives and directions for environmental preservation. Consequently, both kinds of documents are public decisions having an impact on the environment. The code for the environment provides that the projects of local climate, air and energy plan are available to the public in electronic form, for a minimum period of 1 month, to allow its participation.

The Tribunal has received a number of statements of grounds from residents and others expressing concern about the visual impact of the dwelling; the impact upon native vegetation; the impact of the accessway upon the Surry River floodway; the threat to bird and small mammal species and Aboriginal middens; and the appropriateness of the dwelling having regard to climate change, the Victorian Coastal Strategy (VCS) and Glenelg’s Strategic Futures Plan (SFP). As part of its decision VCAT considered Clause 13.01-1 of the State Planning Policy, which requires authorities to manage and plan for the possible coastal impacts of climate change [at 70] including the possibility of a 'sea level rise of not less than 0.8 metres by 2100'. This requirement was interpreted by VCAT to mean that authorities may consider sea level rises that are greater than 0.8 metres. Whether such a consideration ?is appropriate will depend upon the circumstances of the particular site, the nature of the proposal and the scientific information available at the time. Clause 13.01-1 also calls for an application of ?the precautionary principle to planning and management decision-making when considering the risks associated with climate change.’ In this case, despite accepting that the risk of coastal impacts at the site was low, the Tribunal held that the primary dune system and the estuary remained vulnerable to the affects of climate change. The Tribunal further stated that the Victorian Coastal Strategy cautioned against development that would compromise future ability to adapt to the impacts of climate change and respond to emerging climate science The Tribunal also took into account the following points in rejecting the issue of a permit: the location of the proposed site was undesirable, being on the slope of a primary sand dune; the dwelling did not maintain or enhance the coastal landscape character of the area; the site’s capacity for on-site containment of domestic wastewater was not satisfactorily demonstrated; the site access required would significantly disturb a wetland; the dwelling wouldn’t blend into the surrounding landscape and would occupy an effective buffer space that protected the town.",,"Application to review the failure of the Glenelg Shire Council to grant a permit.","Draft",
58,"Secretary of State for Energy & Climate Change v. Friends of the Earth & Others","Administrative Case","GBR","United Kingdom","GBR","United Kingdom",,"[2012] EWCA Civ 28","In April 2010, the secretary of state for energy and climate change introduced a scheme to encourage the installation of generators for small-scale, low-carbon electricity generation (the scheme), including solar panels. The scheme required licensed electricity suppliers to pay a sum of money per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by such systems to the installer (the feed-in tariff). The original feed-in tariff was to be fixed for 25 years, subject to the Retail Prices Index (RPI). The scheme was established and came into effect pursuant to the Feed-in Tariffs (Specified Maximum Capacity and Functions Order) 2010, SI 2010/678 and by amendments to the standard licence conditions issued to electricity suppliers. The procedure for making modifications to the licence conditions in relation to the scheme was contained in section 42 of the Energy Act 2008. In October 2011, the secretary of state issued a consultation paper. The consultation period was due to expire on 23 December. The consultation paper proposed a reduction in the feed-in tariff payable for electricity generated by small solar systems. The proposed new tariffs were to come into force from 1 April 2012 (the reference date). The new tariff was also to apply to installations installed and certified on or before 12 December 2011. Therefore those installations would only receive the current tariff until 1 April 2012. The secretary of state’s assessment of impact showed a potential reduction in uptake of small solar systems of 70% between 12 December 2011 and 1 April 2012. The claimants applied for judicial review of the proposal. The judge found that the scheme did not evince an intention on behalf of parliament to allow the secretary of state to make the proposed modification, and held that that modification was therefore unlawful. The secretary of state appealed. The issue was whether the judge had erred. Consideration was given to section 41 of the 2008 act. The appeal would be dismissed. The concept of a rate of payment fixed during the period of generation by reference to the date the installation became eligible for payment had been fundamental to the scheme. It had provided an assurance as to the rate of return to an owner who paid a capital sum before the installation coming into operation, subject to an adjustment in accordance with the RPI. That the scheme had provided for a fixed rate of return during the period of generation was a critical consideration. The structure of the scheme had fixed the rate by reference to the year the installation had became eligible for payment. It had not provided for a rate which might fluctuate according to the yearly decisions of the secretary of state, irrespective of the year when the installation became eligible. It was not possible to recognise in the standard licence conditions or elsewhere a scheme in which the tariffs might have varied, without regard to the date when the installation became eligible and without any indication within the scheme of what amount the owner of the installation might have received, or as to how it had to be calculated. The scheme had provided for a predetermined rate, not such rate as from time to time might have been determined. In those circumstances, a modification of the feed-in tariff payment rate, in respect of installations which had become eligible before the modification, would have a retrospective effect. Because the scheme had fixed a rate by reference to the year the installation had become eligible, reduction of that rate (apart from fluctuations in the RPI) would have had a retrospective effect. Therefore, such legislation would only have been valid if the empowering provision contained in section 41 of the 2008 act had authorised such an effect. However, on a proper construction, section 41 of the 2008 act contained no power to introduce a modification which reduced a fixed rate by reference to an installation becoming eligible before the modification. Accordingly, the secretary of state had had no power to make that modification.",,"The Secretary of State appealed a parlimentary decision that a proposed modification to a law conducted was unlawful.","Draft",

The reason: authorizing the runway would do more harm to the public interest than good, primarily because it would be contrary to Austria’s national and international obligations to mitigate the causes of climate change. Of the authorities cited by the court, the most important was Austria’s Climate Protection Act of 2011, which set emissions reduction targets for various sectors, including the transport sector. Because a third runway was expected to increase Austria’s annual CO2 emissions, the court concluded that it would be at odds with the provisions of the 2011 Act as well as with Austria’s constitution and its international commitments under EU law and the Paris Agreement.

The Austrian Constitutional Court overturned the Federal Administrative Court’s decision in June 2017, citing multiple errors that led the lower court to improperly give weight to climate change and land use considerations in the balancing test it used to consider the public’s interest in a third runway. The errors identified by the Constitutional Court included:
- misconstruing the Air Traffic Law’s instruction to consider environmental protection over-broadly by factoring in environmental impacts beyond those directly attributable to air traffic;
- wrongly including in emissions projections aircraft emissions attributable to flight segments other than landing and takeoff;
- improperly superimposing regional greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets on an analysis of legal rights and obligations under the federal Air Traffic Law; and
- misapplication of the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, which the Constitutional Court explained are the source of international obligations for Austria but are not generally applicable in the domestic legal context (""sie erzeugen daher nur eine völkerrechtliche Verpflichtung Österreichs und sind innerstaatlich nicht unmittelbar anwendbar"").",,"Prevent construction of third runway at Vienna's airport","Draft",

Byron Shire Council","Administrative Case","AUS","Australia","AUS","Australia",,"[2016] NSWSC 169","A group of plaintiffs who own property along Belongil Beach in New South Wales, Australia sought damages from the local government authority, the Byron Shire Council, to cover the costs of erecting shoreline protections on their parcels and to compensate for lost value to their properties from encroaching seas. Plaintiffs alleged that the need for those protections and the cause of the properties’ partial loss of value was the fault of the Council. In the 1960s and 70s, the Council constructed a form of hard shoreline armoring—“an artificial headland protected by a rock seawall.” Then, between 2006 and 2010, the Council issued draft planning documents (i) prohibiting the plaintiffs from armoring their own segments of shoreline and (ii) proposing a policy of managed retreat in response to rising seas and an encroaching shoreline. The Coastal Protection Act provides that such plans only become final and effective after approval by the New South Wales Minister for Planning; the Council withdrew its draft Coastal Zone Management Plan in May 2011, before the Minister considered it.

Plaintiffs presented two alternative theories in support of their claim: either that the Council was negligent for installing hard shoreline armoring that has since displaced wave action to plaintiffs’ adjacent portions of beach, worsening erosion there; or that the council’s armoring constitutes an instance of public nuisance. Plaintiffs also argued that their injury was compounded by the Council’s issuance and withdrawal of planning documents, and persistent position that managed retreat is the preferred policy response to shoreline encroachment.

After the plaintiffs’ suit survived a motion to dismiss in March 2016, the Council’s insurers, who had been steering the defense in the case, agreed to a settlement. As a result, the court never determined legal liability for the claims alleged. The settlement’s terms bar the Council from removing existing coastal armoring (chiefly rock, concrete, and rubble barriers) on the plaintiffs’ parcels unless the plaintiffs agree to such removal. Should plaintiffs want to add to that armoring, the must apply within one year of the settlement, dated August 2016, and then must make the requested additions within one year of approval of their application. Any subsequent repairs or additions may only be proposed after 20 years, and the Council has not guaranteed that such proposals would be approved.",,"Seek declaratory judgment and damages in relation to shoreline armoring restrictions and policy of planned retreat","Draft",

Notably, the project would operate until about 2060. The court, after observing that the statute does not expressly contemplate climate change, held that such considerations are relevant and that their absence from the environmental review of the project made its approval unlawful. This question came before the court as a result of EarthLife Africa Johannesburg's appeals. The first appeal was submitted to the Minister of Environmental Affairs to challenge the adequacy of the project's environmental review; EarthLife argued that the review was invalid because it largely ignored climate change. The second was submitted to the High Court in Pretoria to challenge the Minister's mealy-mouthed determination that the review was legally valid even though it would have to be supplemented by a climate change analysis because issues related to climate mitigation and adaptation had not ""comprehensively assessed and/or considered.""

The court cited several reasons, including South Africa’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, for its conclusion that climate change is indeed a relevant consideration for the environmental review of the Thabametsi Project.

Smith, the High Court of Australia effectively resolved a question about this review process, namely how to interpret the emissions of coal burned by the end-user of Australian coal. Environmentalists have long argued that even though coal emissions are remote from the mine, they should be considered in EIAs because they are a foreseeable result of mining and would not necessarily occur if the coal were not dug out of an Australian mine. The opposing view holds that coal combustion is physically remote from mining operations, that demand rather than supply drives the market for coal (meaning that mining more Australian coal does not necessarily cause more emissions globally), and that the Environmental Protection Act therefore does not require consideration of coal combustion emissions in EIAs for mines. The Coast and Country decision adopts the latter view.

The High Court has not, by refusing to review the Supreme Court of Queensland's decision, endorsed that court’s reasoning, but it has indicated that it will not take up cases challenging the conclusion in Coast and Country regarding the proper scope of a mine’s EIA. Legally, the basis for that conclusion relates to lower courts' responsibility for determining factual questions, such as the scope of coal mining operations and the nature of the market for coal. Practically, that conclusion means that environmentalists cannot expect to persuade Queensland courts that the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld) requires consideration of whether a new coal mine will increase global greenhouse gas emissions.",,"Determine scope of environmental impacts to be considered on review of proposed coal mining operation","Draft",

The court declared that approval void on the grounds that it was at odds with the language of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act (NSW) 1979 and with the principles of precaution and intergenerational equity—“the environmental assessment must be broad, as a matter of law.” These, contrary to the Minister’s view, warranted consideration of Scope 3 emissions given the circumstances of the mine and the sufficient degree of evident causation between its Scope 3 emissions and adverse environmental impacts in New South Wales.",,"Consideration of Scope 3 emissions in EIA for planned coal mine","Draft",

29,"Friends of the Irish Environment CLG v. Fingal County Council","Administrative Case","IRL","Ireland","IRL","Ireland",,"2017 No.344 JR","Friends of the Irish Environment challenged the Fingal County Council’s decision to issue a five-year extension to the Dublin Airport Authority for their planning permission to construct a new runway. The court declined to grant any of the relief sought by plaintiffs because they failed to assert a viable claim for standing. However, in a historic first, the High Court issued a judgment recognizing “a personal constitutional right to an environment” under the Irish Constitution. Despite finding a lack of standing, the High Court issued a comprehensive review of the merits in anticipation of a future appeal.

The High Court declared that, “A right to an environment that is consistent with the human dignity and well-being of citizens at large is an essential condition for the fulfilment of all human rights. It is an indispensable existential right that is enjoyed universally, yet which is vested personally as a right that presents and can be seen always to have presented, and to enjoy protection, under Art. 40.3.1° of the Constitution.” The Court elaborated that this right was not so “Utopian” as to prevent enforcement, but would rather become enforceable once made concrete through the definition and demarcation of specific duties and obligations. The High Court explained that recognizing this previously unenumerated constitutional right was a first step in this process to define and demarcate a right to an environment.

However, the High Court did not find that the Fingal County Council violated this newly recognized right to an environment by extending the planning permission for the runway. The Court explained, “. . . even though the court accepts that members of the [Friends of Irish Environment] enjoy the contended-for constitutional right, and that the [Friends of the Irish Environment] itself has standing as a body corporate, and has a sufficient basis to contend for recognition of that existing but unenumerated constitutional right, the [Friends of the Irish Environment] nevertheless did not have a right to participate in the extension decision under [Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000] (there is no such right of participation) and it has failed to establish that there is, by reference to that section and on the facts presenting, any disproportionate interference with the personal constitutional right to an environment that is consistent with the human dignity and well-being of citizens at large. In truth, the court sees in [Section 42] nothing more than a proper and proportionate legislative interference with the said, ever-present and now expressly recognised personal constitutional right.”

Further, the High Court ruled that Friends of the Irish Environment did not fulfill standing requirements under section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, Article 11 of the Consolidated EIA Directive, or the “Aarhus Convention” (i.e. the UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters adopted on 25th June 1998 in the Danish city of Aarhus). The High Court found that neither the Planning and Development Act 2000 nor the Consolidated EIA contained requirements for further public participation in granting an extension of a planning permission. Claims concerning the original decision to grant a planning permission in 2007 were deemed impermissible collateral attacks.

The Court did not find that the Section 15 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 changed the substance of Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act in a way relevant to the claims of this case. Section 15 creates an obligation that ""A relevant body shall, in the performance of its functions, have regard to . . . the furtherance of the national transition objective, and the objective of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the effects of climate change in the State."" The High Court said that the Fingal Council would only need to provide reasons if it elected to entirely depart from the objectives of Section 15. The High Court did not believe this this sort of departure was present in the case at hand.",,"Applicability of a constitutional right to the environment and public participation requirements to granting a five-year extension of a planning permission for an airport runway","Draft",

The Secretary of State for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy","Administrative Case","GBR","United Kingdom","GBR","United Kingdom",,"Claim No. CO/16/2018","Plan B Earth, a charity with the mission to realize the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, has filed a climate change lawsuit against the Secretary of State for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (Secretary of State). Plan B Earth is joined in the lawsuit by 11 citizen claimants ranging in age from 9 to 79 who are impacted by climate change in a variety of ways. The claimants allege that the Secretary of State violated the Climate Change Act 2008 (the 2008 Act) and other law by failing to revise a 2050 carbon reduction target in light of new international law and scientific developments.

On December 8, 2017, the claimants filed a claim form and a document listing their grounds for judicial review at the High Court of Justice Administrative Court. They note that the 2008 Act set a carbon emissions reduction target for the year 2050 that is at least 80% lower than the aggregate total of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 (the 2050 target). This 2050 target was consistent with limiting average warming to 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. The claimants argue that the Secretary of State should make the 2050 target more ambitious to reflect scientific developments since 2008 and the Paris Agreement’s intention to limit average warming to 1.5 degrees C. Under Section 2 of the 2008 Act, the Secretary of State has the authority to revise the target in light of scientific developments and international law.

Claimants present five grounds for seeking judicial review of the Secretary of State’s failure to revise the 2050 target: (1) it is ultra vires, because it frustrates the legislative purpose of the 2008 Act; (2) it is based on an error of law regarding the objective of the Paris Agreement; (3) it is irrational, because it fails to take into account and / or inappropriately weighs considerations including the risks of global climate change and predictions of future technical innovation; (4) it violates the Human Rights Act 1998; and (5) it breaches the public sector equality duty set out in Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010.

Claimants seek declaratory relief that the Secretary of State acted unlawfully in violation of his responsibilities under the 2008 Act and a “mandatory order that the Secretary of State revise the 2050 target in accordance with the purpose of the 2008 Act and the UK’s international law obligations, ensuring, at a minimum, that the 2050 target commits the UK to an equitable contribution the Paris Agreement objective and that it conforms to the precautionary principle.” They also seek what other relief the court deems appropriate and costs.

In February, 2018, the claimants' application for judicial review was denied on all five grounds. The claimants renewed their application for review. On March 20, 2018, a permission hearing took place at the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand to determine if the case was strong enough to merit a full hearing. The hearing was adjourned after the Justice decided that the complexity of the issues would require a full-day permission hearing. The Justice also requested a more detailed statement from the Committee on Climate Change, an independent, statutory body established under the Climate Change Act 2008. The Committee is an interested party in the litigation.

On July 20, 2018, the High Court found the claims were not arguable and denied permission for the case to proceed. Plan B Earth appealed the decision on multiple grounds, including alleging that the judge misinterpreted Article 2(1)(a)of the Paris Agreement. Appellants argue that the judge incorrectly read this provision to allow for a range of ambition rather than holding the UK for responsible for “[h]olding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.” Accordingly, appellants further argue that the judge incorrectly found the current UK 2050 climate target compatible with the Paris Agreement due to this misinterpretation of required ambition.

On January 25, 2019, the Court of Appeal rejected Plan B's appeal of the High Court's denial to hear the case, marking the end of the appeal process. The court concluded that none of the 7 stated grounds had a real prospect of success. The court did not find an error in law in regard to an alleged failure to exercise discretion to amend the 2050 target, nor did the court find that the Secretary of State misunderstood the Paris Agreement or the advice of the Committee on Climate Change. While acknowledging that a governmental response to the need for environmental protection engages human rights in general, the court declined to find that relevant given its other findings that officials exercised proper discretion and understanding of the Paris Agreement and climate-related advice.","Plan B, Paris Agreement, Climate Change Act","Government’s alleged violation of the Climate Change Act 2008 for failure to revise its 2050 carbon emissions reduction target in light of the Paris Agreement and the latest science.","Draft",

The opinion noted that the adverse effects of environmental degradation and climate change both affect human rights. This finding suggests that the right to a healthy environment may serve as a pathway for lawsuits brought in regard to climate change-related harms. The opinion further discussed the responsibility of governments for significant environmental damage that they cause within and beyond their borders. The Court’s advisory opinion enables all States who recognize the jurisdiction of the Court—and the citizens of those countries—to file claims regarding environmental harms that impact their human rights. In such a case, the Court would assess whether the respondent State met three types of obligations: 1. Obligations to Prevent Environmental Damages: States must: A) issue regulations to prevent damages, B) establish contingency plans to minimize the possibility of major environmental accidents, C) mitigate significant damage that has already occurred, and D) carry out environmental impact studies under the conditions indicated by the Court. The Court requires environmental impact studies to address cumulative impacts, allow the participation of interested persons, and respect the traditions and culture of indigenous peoples. These studies must also be conducted by independent entities and occur prior to the activities that they evaluate. 2. Obligations to Cooperate: States must: A) cooperate in good faith with States and individuals potentially affected by environmental damage, B) notify potentially affected States that a planned activity under their jurisdiction could generate a risk of significant transboundary damages and of environmental emergencies, and C) negotiate in good faith with States potentially affected by significant transboundary harm. 3. Obligations to Provide Information, Justice, and Public Participation: States must: A) access to information related to possible effects on the environment, B) the opportunity for citizens to publicly participate in making decisions and policies that may affect the environment, and C) access to justice through national courts in regard to their environmental obligations. The Court clarified that persons potentially affected by transboundary damages must have access to justice without discrimination based on their nationality, residence, or the location of the environmental damage.

T-330/18","Ten families, including children, from Portugal, Germany, France, Italy, Romania, Kenya, Fiji, and the Swedish Sami Youth Association Sáminuorra, brought an action in the EU General Court seeking to compel the EU to take more stringent greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions reductions. Plaintiffs allege that the EU’s existing target to reduce domestic ghg emissions by 40% by 2030, as compared to 1990 levels, is insufficient to avoid dangerous climate change and threatens plaintiffs’ fundamental rights of life, health, occupation, and property.

The lawsuit has two major components. First, plaintiffs bring a nullification action, asking the court to declare three EU legal acts as void for failing to set adequate ghg emissions targets. The three EU legal acts are: Directive 2003/87/EC governing emissions from large power generation installations (ETS); regulation 2018/EU on emissions from industry, transport, buildings, agriculture, and etc. (ESR); and regulation 2018/EU on emissions from and removals by land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF). Plaintiffs argue that inadequate emissions reductions violate higher order laws that protect fundamental rights to health, education, occupation, and equal treatment as well as provide obligations to protect the environment. These higher rank laws include: the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (ChFR), the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Paris Agreement. Plaintiffs ask the court to order that the three emissions reductions laws remain in force until improved versions of the Acts can be enacted. Art. 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) is the basis for this procedural action.

The second action concerns non-contractual liability. Article 340 of the TFEU provides a mechanism for injunctive relief when three conditions are met: 1) there is an unlawful act by the EU institution(s), 2) the unlawful act is a serious breach of a law that protects individual rights, and 3) there is a sufficient causal link between the breach and the damages.

<td class=""xl65"" width=""121"" height=""20"">Ridhima Pandey, a nine-year-old from the Uttarakhand region, is the named plaintiff in a climate change case filed in March 2017 with the National Green Tribunal of India. Plaintiff’s petition argues that the Public Trust Doctrine, India’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, and India’s existing environmental laws and climate-related policies oblige greater action to mitigate climate change. It also argues that the term “environment,” as used in the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, necessarily encompasses the climate. The case was brought pursuant to section 2(m) of the National Green Tribunal Act 2010, which authorizes claims that raise “a substantial question relating to the environment.” In addition to those legal provisions, the petition cites the principles of sustainable development, precaution, and intergenerational equity, as well as judicial decisions based on similar legal principles in the Netherlands (Urgenda Foundation v. Kingdom of the Netherlands), Pakistan, (Leghari v. Pakistan), and the U.S. (Juliana v. United States).

The petition notes that India is the third-largest national emitter of greenhouse gases (behind China and the U.S.) and among those countries that are most susceptible to adverse climate change impacts. It identifies 1° degree Celsius or 350ppm of atmospheric carbon dioxide as the critical pair of thresholds for India (and the world) to avoid exceeding for the sake of avoiding severe climatic changes—facts described in the petition as rooted in “[t]he best climate science.”

To remedy the alleged injury to the present and future climate, the petition asks the court to order the national government to undertake a variety of measures, including but not limited to inclusion of climate change in the issues considered by environmental impact assessments, preparation of a national greenhouse gas emissions inventory, and preparation of a national carbon budget against which particular projects’ emissions impacts can be assessed.</td>

<td class=""xl67"" align=""left"" width=""121"" height=""20"">Representatives of the Mataatua District Maori Council have filed a claim and supporting memorandum in the Waitangi Tribunal, the forum where disputes over the performance of the Waitangi Treaty between the Maori and the government of New Zealand are heard and resolved. The claimants allege that New Zealand has breached its obligations to the Maori by failing to implement policies that will address climate change. Upon learning from the Tribunal Registry that the claim would be heard after 2020, the claimants filed an urgency application requesting an earlier hearing. That application seeks the following forms of relief:

- a declaration from the Tribunal that the government has breached its treaty obligations;
- a recommendation that New Zealand revise its emissions reduction targets upward to a level that corresponds with keeping the global concentration of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions below 450ppm—the level that corresponds with the 2°C threshold that demarcates a stable climate from a potentially unstable one;
- a recommendation that New Zealand adopt different mitigation policies, including the restructuring or replacement of its Emissions Trading Scheme;
- a recommendation that New Zealand adopt policies that facilitate adaptation in ways specific to locations and resources relied upon by the Maori.

It bases these requests for relief on several points of fact and law. The most basic of these is the relationship between sources of GHG emissions and climate changes, and the relationship between climate change and various adverse impacts on locations and resources relied upon by the Maori for physical and cultural purposes. The application also points out that New Zealand’s Nationally Determined Contribution, submitted following the Paris Climate Conference in 2015, committed the country to reduce emissions by 11% relative to 1990 levels by 2030. It contrasts this target with the increase of GHG emissions in New Zealand of 24.1% relative to their 1990 levels by 2015 and the current expectation that they will increase to 30% increase by 2020. Further facts noted in the application include that New Zealand’s government encourages oil and gas exploration, controls an entity that mines coal, and controls another entity that is responsible for much of the recent conversion of forests to dairy farms. Having described the factual basis that links government policies adverse climate impacts, the claimants then point out that provisions of the Waitangi Treaty make the government responsible for the “active protection” of natural resources such as forests and fisheries on behalf of the Maori. In characterizing that violation, the claimants quote from the recent decision in Juliana v. United States regarding the public trust doctrine and characterize that reasoning as relevant to their claim.</td>

Claimants allege that the Secretary’s national policy statement supporting the expansion of Heathrow Airport violated Section 10 of the Planning Act 2008 (“the 2008 Act”).

Claimants argue that since the 2008 Act requires the Secretary to pursue the objective of sustainable development and consider the desirability of mitigating and adapting to climate change, it further gives rise to implicit obligations to consider the advice of the Committee on Climate Change (“the CCC”), the government’s obligations under the Paris Agreement and commitment to review its national climate change targets in light of the Paris Agreement. Claimants maintain that the Secretary violated these implicit obligations by supporting the airport expansion without adequate consideration of the insufficiency of the current UK 2050 climate target (“2050 Target”), the UK’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, the CCC’s recommendations to review the 2050 Target, and government’s recent agreement to review the 2050 Target. Accordingly, they assert the Secretary’s actions were both ultra vires and irrational.

Plaintiffs additionally allege violations of Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 and the Human Rights Act 1998. Claimants seek declaratory relief, specifically a declaration that the Secretary of State acted unlawfully in violation of section 5 of the 2008 Act.</td>

<td class=""xl66"" align=""left"" width=""121"" height=""20"">Environmental groups filed suit against the Ontarian government, alleging the government failed to meet legal requirements for public consultation on regulations that would end Ontario’s cap and trade program and a proposed bill that would undercut the province’s legislative regime for combatting climate change. Plaintiffs argue that both the regulations and bill violate requirements under the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) for public participation in the development of environmentally significant regulations and legislation.

The lawsuit concerns Ontario Regulation 386/18 filed on July 3, 2018 by the Minister of Environment, Conservation and Parks. The government did not conduct a public consultation process and filed a claim that the 2018 election was “substantially equivalent” to the 30-day consultation process required by law. Plaintiffs argue that the government was still required to undertake public consultation for the regulation under the EBR and that the regulation is ultra vires because it contradicts the purpose of the “Climate Change Mitigation and Low-Carbon Economy Act,” the enabling act for this regulation. The lawsuit additionally concerns “Bill 4, the Cap and Trade Cancellation Act, 2018” filed on July 25, 2018. This bill would repeal the “Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016” which includes greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Plaintiffs argue that this bill would have a significant environmental impact because it would repeal existing greenhouse gas emissions targets without establishing new targets. If there is a significant environmental impact, then the government must undertake the mandatory notice and comment process required by the EBR.

Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief and ask the Court to quash the regulations. The case is tentatively set for expedited hearing on September 21, 2018.</td>

Bitter argued that, because Ziegelwerk Höxter had ceased its business activity before the opening of insolvency procedures in September 2011, it was no longer obliged to report or surrender its emissions allowances for 2011. Instead, she claimed that Ziegelwerk Höxter's contingent liabilities were solely to be registered as claims in the insolvency procedure.

The Court held that the EU legislature must be allowed broad discretion in applying penalties and that the relatively high level of the penalty is justified by the need to have infringements of the obligation to surrender a sufficient number of allowances treated in a stringent and consistent manner throughout the European Union. The Court also noted that Directive 2003/87 grants operators a reasonable amount of time to comply with their surrender obligations and that the fact that the amount of the fine involved exceeded that of one in a previous case, in which the Court ruled that fines for penalties to surrender are consistent with the principle of proportionality, was irrelevant.

In light of the principle of proportionality, the Court ruled, there is nothing in this case that affects the second sentence of Article 16(3) of Directive 2003/87, which does provide for a penalty of EUR 100 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted for which the operator has not surrendered allowances.",,"Company challenged the principle of proportionality under EU ETS","Draft",

The operators argued that they were entitled to additional allowances because their installations consume heat from wasted greenhouse gases emitted at sub-installations. They argued that these additional allowances followed from a correct legal interpretation of Directive 2003/87/EC, Commission Decision 2013/448/EU, and Commission Decision 2011/278/EU.

Previously, in Case C-191/14, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that the European Commission's correction factor calculation was invalid because it ignored relevant information, including information about what emissions fell under the purview of free allocation. The Court remanded the correction factor calculation to the European Commission, which it gave 10 months to correct.

The ECJ held that the ruling in Case C-191/14 applied to the facts of this case, and therefore that the operators are not entitled to additional allowances. It also reaffirmed its previous ruling that the European Commission has a period of 10 months from the decision in Case C-191/14 to correct the correction factor calculation, but also that any measures adopted by the European Commission during that period on the basis of the provisions invalidated by Case C-191/14 cannot be called into question. Lastly, it ruled that Commission Decision 2011/278/EU remains valid and must be interpreted in such a way as to prevent double-allocation of emissions allowances.

When designing the monitoring plan for the installation operated by EPZ for the third period of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the Bestuur van de Nederlandse Emissieautoriteit (Nea) considered that coal lost due to its self-heating during the storage period could not be regarded as fuel exported from EPZ's installation within the meaning of Article 27(2) of Regulation No 601/2012.

Consequently, the NEa refused to approve modifications of the monitoring plan sought by EPZ and later rejected EPZ's objection to their initial decision. EPZ then lodged an appeal with the Dutch Raad van State (Council of State), seeking to have the latter decision annulled. The Council of State referred the case to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and asked for a preliminary ruling on two questions.

(1) Could EPZ's storage facility be considered an “installation” as referred to in Article 3(e) of Directive 2003/87/EC?

(2) Could EPZ's lost coal due to its self-heating during storage be considered “fuel exported from the installation” as referred to in Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) No 601/2012?

On the first question, the ECJ ruled that a fuel storage site of a coal-fired power plant is part of an ""installation"" within the meaning of Article 3(e) of Directive 2003/87/EC. The ECJ ruled that the coal's self-heating during storage does not amount to combustion and that it was not apparent that the coal's self-heating required 20 MW of thermal input (two of the requirements for the storage site to be considered an installation under Annex I of Directive 2003/87/EC). However, the ECJ ruled that the coal is essential to the functioning of the power plant and is therefore directly associated with the plant’s activity. Moreover, because the coal's self-heating emits greenhouse gases, storing coal is an activity that could have an effect on emissions and pollution within the meaning of Article 3(e) of Directive 2003/87/EC. The ECJ ruled that the fact that the storage site is located approximately 800 metres from the power plant and is separated from it by a public road is irrelevant.

On the second question, the ECJ ruled that coal lost due to self-heating while in storage on a site that is part of an installation cannot be regarded as coal exported from that installation. Because the storage site is part of an installation within the meaning of Article 3(e) of Directive 2003/87/EC, it cannot be regarded as a separate installation. Therefore, coal lost due to self-heating cannot be considered to be exported from the installation in question.",,"Corporation challenged monitoring plan for coal storage","Draft",

<p class=""C01PointnumeroteAltN"">The question before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in this case was whether Article 13(6) of the 2004 law, which allows the relevant Luxembourgish minister to order the surrender, without full or partial compensation, of allowances issued but not used, is compatible with Directive 2003/87/EC, or whether Directive 2003/87/EC must be interpreted as precluding national laws that allow the competent authorities to require the surrender without compensation of emissions allowances that have been issued but not used.</p>
The ECJ held that Directive 2003/87 must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation that allows competent national authorities to require the surrender, without full or partial compensation, of unused allowances that have been improperly issued to an operator, as a result of the failure by the latter to comply with the obligation to inform the competent authority in due time of the cessation of the operation of an installation.

Trinseo applied for free allocation of emission allowances to its installation for the trading period 2013?2020, which the German government denied because polycarbonates do not fall under the list of products approved for free allocation. Trinseo originally claimed that it was entitled to free allocation of emissions allowances because the steam it uses during the production of polymers requires the emission of greenhouse gases. The German government rejected this application and, subsequently, Trinseo sued the German government in the Berlin Administrative Court, which referred the case to the ECJ for preliminary ruling.

The ECJ considered ""whether Article 2(1) of Directive 2003/87 must be interpreted as meaning that an installation for the production of polymers, in particular the polymer polycarbonate, such as the installation at issue in the main proceedings, which obtains the heat needed for that production from a third-party installation, falls within the activity of ‘[p]roduction of bulk organic chemicals by cracking, reforming, partial or full oxidation or by similar processes’, within the meaning of Annex I to that directive, so that it must be considered to fall within the scope of the emissions allowance trading scheme established by that directive."" The ECJ ruled that, because Directive 2003/87/EC is intended to incentivise emissions reductions in companies, and because polycarbonate production does not directly produce emissions, Trinseo was not entitled to free allocation of emissions trading allowances. Rather, only the company that directly emits greenhouse gases as the result of producing steam, which might later be used to manufacture polymers, is entitled to free emissions allocations.",,"Company challenged rejection of application of free allocation of emissions allowances","Draft",

The legal documents are not yet available for the case, but in a press release, plaintiffs allege that RED II will accelerate widespread forest devastation and significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions by not counting CO2 emissions from burning wood fuels.

Plaintiffs describe the lawsuit as documenting the environmental, societal, and public health impacts associated with the increased logging, wood pellet manufacturing, and production of biomass energy driven by the RED II forest biomass policy. They allege that the policy is incompatible with the environmental objectives of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and violates the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights (Art. 32 and 57).The plaintiffs are a group of individuals and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from Estonia, Ireland, France, Romania, Slovakia, and the United States.

8,"Family Farmers and Greenpeace Germany v. Germany","Administrative Case","DEU","Germany","DEU","Germany",,"00271/17 /R /SP","Three German families and Greenpeace Germany have filed suit in the Berlin Administrative Court against the German federal government for backing off its 2020 greenhouse gas emission reduction target in alleged violation of plaintiffs’ constitutional rights to life and health, property, and occupational freedom. The German families are organic farmers who claim they are already experiencing the impacts of climate change. The claims are brought under German and EU law.

An English summary of the pleadings released by Greenpeace reports that by the German Environmental Ministry’s own calculations, the German government will miss its climate goal to emit 40 percent less greenhouse gases (GHGs) by 2020, compared to 1990 levels (Climate Protection Program 2020). Plaintiffs allege this failure encroaches on their human rights in violation of the German Constitution, the Grundgesetz, specifically under Article 2(2) (right to life and health), Article 12(1) (occupational freedom), and Article 14(1) (right to property). They further allege that failure to meet the Climate Protection Program 2020 target violates Germany’s minimum obligations under the EU Effort Sharing Decision (406/2009/EC).

Greenpeace further reports that plaintiffs are asking for court orders determining that the Government is obliged to: 1) implement the national Climate Protection Program 2020 by updating or supplementing appropriate measures to meet the 2020 target, 2) compensate for the excess of approximately 650 million tons of CO2 equivalent between 2007 and today due to insufficient implementation of the 2020 target; and 3) supplement the national Climate Protection Program 2020 to meet the reduction targets set out in European environmental law.

This is the first climate lawsuit to refer to the recent publication of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Special Report on 1.5°C.

7,"Notre Affaire à Tous and Others v. France","Administrative Case","FRA","France","FRA","France",,"Not available","On December 17, 2018, four nonprofits sent a “lettre préalable indemnitaire” (letter of formal notice) to Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and 12 members of the French government, initiating the first stage in a legal proceeding against the French government for inadequate action on climate change. This type of letter is part of a legal proceeding known as “recours en carence fautive” (action for failure to act). According to their press release, the plaintiffs allege that the French government’s failure to implement proper measures to effectively address climate change violated a statutory duty to act.

The four plaintiff groups are Fondation pour la Nature et l’Homme (FNH), Greenpeace France, Notre Affaire à Tous and Oxfam France. The press release argues that the government’s duty to act on climate change can be inferred from the French Constitution, the European Convention on Human Rights, and many other international agreements, (including the Stockholm Declaration, the World Charter for Nature, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Climate Agreement). They further infer this right from European legislation, (including the Renewable Energy and Climate Change Package and other EU directives), and domestic policies, (including statutory laws such as Grenelle I and the Act of 17 August 2015 on energy transition for green growth).

On February 15, 2019, the French government rejected the plaintiffs' request. On March 14, 2019, the plaintiffs initiated the lawsuit by filing a ""summary request"" before the Administrative Court of Paris. The plaintiffs' press release describes the lawsuit as challenging the state's inaction on climate change and failure to meet its own goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing renewable energy, and limiting energy consumption.",,"Whether the French government’s failure to take further action on climate change violates a statutory duty to act under domestic and international law.","Draft",

Ltd challenged the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities, and Local Government under section 288 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 for denying a planning permission for a coal mining project. The High Court quashed the denial on two grounds, including the Secretary’s inadequate explanation of how preventing the project would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The Northumberland County Council granted planning permission to H. J. Banks & Co. Ltd for a surface mine for the extraction of coal, sandstone, and fireclay in the Highthorn area of southeast Northumberland. The Secretary called the application in for his own determination and after a public inquiry declined to grant permission for the project, giving considerable weight in his decision-making to the adverse effects of greenhouse gas emissions. H. J. Banks & Co. Ltd challenged the denial on two grounds. The first ground alleged an error in the Secretary’s interpretation of balancing considerations under paragraph 149 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The second ground alleged that the Secretary wrongly weighed greenhouse gas emissions resulting from burning coal at power plants and that the Secretary acted inconsistently with previous practice in how the Secretary considered these emissions.

The High Court quashed the decision on grounds one and two. On ground one, the High Court determined that the Secretary had not lawfully weighed the relative costs and benefits of tourism and biodiversity as required under the balancing test of paragraph 149 of the NPPF and related regulations. On ground two, the High Court found that the Secretary provided insufficient reasoning to explain why emissions would be reduced if the coal project was denied because there was not adequate explanation of how power generation would be replaced by less carbon-intensive sources rather than imported coal. The Court found that the Secretary provided inadequate reasoning for how national policy to decarbonize was inconsistent with granting the permission.",,"The legal reasoning required to deny a coal extraction project on the basis of adverse effects from associated greenhouse gas emissions","Draft",

Canada","Administrative Case","CAN","Canada","CAN","Canada",,"500-06","ENvironnement JEUnesse, an environmental nonprofit, has applied in the Superior Court of Québec to bring a climate change-related class action against the Canadian government on behalf of Québec citizens aged 35 and under. ENvironnement JEUnesse reports that it has asked the Court, inter alia, to declare that the Government of Canada has failed in its obligations to protect the fundamental rights of young people under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Québec Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The organization alleges that the government violated plaintiffs’ rights by setting a greenhouse gas reduction target insufficient to avoid dangerous climate change impacts and by lacking an adequate plan to reach its greenhouse gas emission target.

More specifically, plaintiffs allege that 1) the “Canadian government's adoption of GHG emission targets that it knows are harmful to human life and health violates the right of class members to life, inviolability and security protected by section 7 of the Canadian Charter and section 1 of the Québec Charter,” and 2) “by adopting inadequate targets and failing to put in place the necessary measures to achieve these targets, the government is violating the class members' right to live in a healthful environment in which biodiversity is preserved, protected by the Québec Charter.”

The class action seeks a declaratory judgment and punitive damages.

Ireland","Administrative Case","IRL","Ireland","IRL","Ireland",,"Not available","An advocacy group, Friends of the Irish Environment (FIE), filed suit in the High Court, arguing that the Irish government’s approval of the National Mitigation Plan in 2017 violated Ireland’s Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, the Constitution of Ireland, and human rights obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly the right to life and the right to private and family life. FIE alleges that the National Mitigation Plan, which seeks to cut emissions by 80 percent by 2050 compared to 1990 levels, is not “fit for purpose” because it is not designed to achieve substantial emissions reductions within the next few decades.

The case was argued before the High Court on January 22, 2019. FIE requested the High Court quash the National Mitigation Plan and order the government to write a new plan.

2,"Commune de Grande-Synthe v. France","Administrative Case","FRA","France","FRA","France",,"Not available","On January 23, 2019, the municipality of Grande-Synthe sued the French government for insufficient action on climate change. The suit was filed in the Conseil d'Etat, the highest administrative court in France. According to an English summary of the case provided by the plaintiffs, the suit alleges that the French government’s failure to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions violates domestic and international law, including the European Convention on Human Rights, the Paris Agreement, the French Environmental Code, and the French Environmental Charter. Plaintiffs stress that particular vulnerability of Grande-Synthe to the impacts of climate change as a low-lying coastal municipality exposed to sea level rise and flooding. According to the plaintiffs’ case summary, Grande-Synthe asks the Conseil d'Etat to direct the government to take legislative and regulatory measures to prioritize action on climate change and to prohibit actions that would increase greenhouse gas emissions. This case is one of two filed in France during early 2019 against the French government for climate inaction and that follows logic set by the 2018 Urgenda decision in the Netherlands. The other case, Notre Affaire à Tous and Others v. France, was filed by nonprofit organizations.",,"Whether the French government’s failure to take further action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions violates domestic and international law","Draft",

Royal Dutch Shell plc.","Administrative Case","NLD","Netherlands","NLD","Netherlands",,90046903,"On Monday, April 5th, 2019, the environmental group Milieudefensie/Friends of the Earth Netherlands and co-plaintiffs served Shell a court summons alleging Shell’s contributions to climate change violate its duty of care under Dutch law and human rights obligations. The case was filed in the Hague Court of Appeals. Co-plaintiffs include other NGOs (ActionAid NL, Both ENDS, Fossielvrij NL, Greenpeace NL,Young Friends of the Earth NL, Waddenvereniging) and more than 17000 citizens. The plaintiffs seek a ruling from the court that Shell must reduce its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels and to zero by 2050, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement.

This case builds on the landmark Urgenda decision which found that the Dutch government’s inadequate action on climate change violated a duty of care to its citizens. In the suit against Shell, plaintiffs extend this argument to private companies, arguing that given the Paris Agreement’s goals and the scientific evidence regarding the dangers of climate change, Shell has a duty of care to take action to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Plaintiffs base this duty of care argument on Article 6:162 of the Dutch Civil Code as further informed by Articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which guarantee rights to life (Article 2) and rights to a private life, family life, home, and correspondence (Article 8). Plaintiffs’ argument outlines how Shell’s long knowledge of climate change, misleading statements on climate change, and inadequate action to reduce climate change help support a finding of Shell’s unlawful endangerment of Dutch citizens and actions constituting hazardous negligence.",,"Whether a private company violated a duty of care and human rights obligations by failing to take adequate action to curb contributions to climate change","Draft",
