The TPI will assess how individual companies are positioningthemselves for the transition to a low-carbon economy through a public, transparentonline tool. The heads of funds involved launched the Initiative this morning at theopening of the stock market at the London Stock Exchange.The Initiative has been led by the Church of England's National Investing Bodiesand the Environment Agency Pension Fund in partnership with the GranthamResearch Institute at the London School of Economics. Data has been provided byFTSE Russell.Preliminary assessments released today include the oil and gas and electricityutilities sectors. As part of a phased rollout, management quality and carbonperformance assessments of additional sectors and individual companies will followin the coming months. The tool has been designed to support the requirements ofthe Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), individuallyprofiling future projected emissions against the two-degree target and currentpublic policy commitments.Preliminary assessments have already highlighted key findings, including:<ul> 	<li>Almost all companies assessed are at least acknowledging climate change asa business issue (39 out of 40). However, few companies are at the level ofstrategic assessment (level 4), meaning most can improve.</li> 	<li>Electricity utilities are marginally more advanced than oil and gas producers</li> 	<li>The typical company is building capacity (15 out of 40 are at level 2),meaning it explicitly recognises climate change as a significant issue for thebusiness, has a policy commitment to action, has set some form of energy orgreenhouse gas emissions target, and discloses its operational greenhousegas emissions</li> 	<li>The majority of companies also have board oversight of the climate changepolicy (on level 3; 28/40), and incorporate ESG issues into executiveremuneration (on level 4; 34/40).</li> 	<li>The most common factors hindering progress are not having set quantitativetargets for reducing operational greenhouse gas emissions (26/40 have not),and not having had operational emissions data verified (22/40 have not).</li></ul>Adam Matthews, Co-Chair of the Initiative and Head of Engagement for the ChurchCommissioners and Church of England Pensions Board, said 'The TransitionPathway Initiative is a tipping point for the market. The Initiative will identifycompanies that are aligned with the transition to the low-carbon economy andthose most exposed to climate transition risk. There can be no doubt about theseriousness with which asset owners are taking account of this risks and it will be akey feature in the discussions we will be having with companies over the comingyears.'Emma Howard Boyd, Chair of the Environment Agency said 'Businesses should beable explain to investors how they plan to manage climate change risks, invest andinnovate on the way to the zero-carbon economy of the future. With the launch ofthe Transition Pathway Initiative, asset owners from around the world are sending astrong signal that portfolios will align in the future with companies that are takingthe transition to a low carbon economy seriously.'Professor Simon Dietz, Co-Director of the Grantham Research Institute at theLondon School of Economics, said 'The TPI brings transition risk to life for assetowners and asset managers. As well as allowing investors to objectively comparethe progress of companies towards a low-carbon economy, the tool highlights thework governments still need to do to align public policy to the two-degree targetagreed in Paris.'Mark Makepeace, CEO of FTSE Russell, said 'The launch of the TPI highlights thegrowing momentum among asset owners to consider the economic implications ofthe transition towards a low-carbon economy into their stewardship and investmentprocesses. FTSE Russell has long been a pioneer in ESG and sustainable investingand we are delighted to have been chosen by the TPI as the data and analyticspartner for this exciting initiative.'Fr'd'ric Janbon, CEO of BNP Paribas Investment Partners, said 'BNP ParibasInvestment Partners is very pleased to be among the asset managers that activelysupport the Transition Pathway Initiative. It is important for asset managers topartner with asset owners, as by doing so we are able to send a unified message tocompanies regarding our expectations of them as they position themselves for thetransition to a low-carbon economy. It also sends a clear signal to the wider worldthat we are actively engaging with companies to help them to work towards greateraction, as well as disclosure of transition risks, in order that their shareholders canmake fully informed investment decisions.'The online tool developed by the TPI '� available at transitionpathwayinitiative.org '�tracks a company's management quality and carbon performance. Managementquality assessments will use data from FTSE Russell to assign companies to one offive levels, ranging from level 0 (no recognition of climate change as a significantissue) to level 4 (climate change deeply integrated into a company's businesspractices). Performance assessments will compare individual companies withinternationally agreed benchmarks made as part of the Paris Agreement. Thesebenchmark emissions pathways will be sector-specific.<em>Notes to editors</em>Progress in reducing carbon emissions is measured against both the two-degreeinternational target, and against national pledges made at the Paris United NationsConference of the Parties - the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).The founding members (AUM of '370bn) are: The Church Commissioners forEngland, the Church of England Pensions Board, CBF Church of England Funds, theCentral Finance Board of the Methodist Church, the Environment Agency PensionFund, the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, RPMI Railpen, the Swedish NationalPension Funds (AP1, AP3 and AP4), USS, Wespath Benefits and Investments and theWest Midlands Pension Fund.The asset managers who are supporting the initiative (AUM of '1.7trn) are: AvivaInvestors, BNP Paribas Investment Partners, Hermes Investment Management,PGGM and Standard Life Investments. HermesEOS will also be using the tool insupport of its engagement with investee companies. BNP Paribas SecuritiesServices, a leading global custodian with $9 trillion in assets under custody, alsoactively supports the initiative.The Church of England is involved through its National Investing Bodies (NIBs) '� theChurch Commissioners for England, Church of England Pensions Fund, and CBFChurch of England Funds.<em>Additional quotes from partners</em>Barbara Boigegrain, CEO and General Secretary of Wespath Benefits andInvestments, said 'For some years, Wespath Benefits and Investments (pensionfund agency of The United Methodist Church) has recognized the transitionunderway to a low-carbon global economy and the need for us to understand thelong-term trends affecting our investments. We will use our leadership position toinfluence other North American funds and investors to use the TPI in analysing theirportfolios.'Euan Stirling, Head of Stewardship and ESG Investment at Standard LifeInvestments, said 'The Transition Pathway Initiative is an important step forward inthe necessary route towards lower carbon intensity. A large gap currently existsbetween governmental commitments on emissions made in Paris in 2015 and thepreparations of companies to help meet those challenges. The TPI will provide auseful tool for us as investors to gauge how effectively companies are addressingthe sustainability of their business plans.'Sir Andreas Whittam Smith, First Church Estates Commissioner of the ChurchCommissioners for England said 'The Transition Pathway Initiative is a significantintervention by church asset owners and others. It will enable us to have a newconversation with companies based on a rigorous understanding of where they siton the transition to a low-carbon economy, and to follow through on thecommitments we have made in our climate change policy.'Johan Magnusson, Chief Executive of AP1 said ""This initiative fills an informationgap and will help us and other investors to make more informed investmentdecisions. We are pleased to be involved at this early stage in the development ofTPI, an initiative well in line with the AP1's sustainability strategy.""Elizabeth Fernando, Head of Equities at USS said 'As a long-term investor USSwants to be able to assess how companies are managing climate change and therisk it poses to their business. The TPI provides a tool for us to do this and as aresult will allow us to make better informed investment decisions improving financialreturns for our members and beneficiaries.""Kieran Quinn, Chair of the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum said: 'As arecognised leader in engaging with companies, LAPFF's participation in theTransition Pathway Initiative will enhance demonstrating the progress of ourengagements on carbon risk with high impact companies on the necessarytransition to a low carbon economy.'Bruce Duguid, Director, EOS, Hermes Investment Management said 'The TransitionPathway Initiative [or TPI] provides a useful framework for setting stretching butfeasible corporate engagement objectives on climate change. We have alreadypiloted this approach in our engagement with coal-exposed companies.'Patricia Espinosa, Executive Secretary of the UN climate convention (UNFCCC) said""I applaud the new Transition Pathway Initiative and its founding members. Itrepresents yet another potentially powerful way of aligning real-world globalinvestments with the real-world urgency of meeting the goals, aims and aspirationof the Paris Climate Change Agreement"".Stephanie Pfeifer, CEO of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change said'IIGCC welcomes the launch of the Transition Pathway Initiative. As investors seekto help drive the changes required to implement the Paris Agreement, it is great tosee new tools emerging that asset owners and managers can employ to assessclimate transition risk through benchmarking corporate climate disclosure andevaluating how well a company is positioning itself as part of the low carbontransition.""Erik Solheim, Head of UN Environment said ""Climate change poses anunprecedented risk to investments. For the sake of portfolios - and the planet - it isimportant that asset owners take action now. That's why we at UN Environmentwelcome the Transition Pathway Initiative and the leadership of the asset ownersbacking it.

It is based on a publically available online tool, hosted by the Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics, which enables the quality of companies' management of carbon emissions to be scrutinised, and their current and future performance tracked against international climate targets. The TPI focuses on high-impact sectors and the largest companies by market capitalisation.<h3>Investors and companies need to ready themselves for the low-carbon economy</h3>Delivering on the overall objective of the Paris Agreement to keep warming of the planet below 2'C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5'C will require above all a fundamental shift away from burning fossil fuels and from energy-intensive manufacturing, towards renewables and energy-efficient technologies.Among companies and perhaps whole industries there will be winners and losers. The overall cost to society of the low-carbon transition <a href=""http://newclimateeconomy.report/2014/"">has been found to be manageable</a>, but financial risks nonetheless exist, particularly if investors are poorly informed about the companies they are invested in.One area of focus has been on whether companies who extract fossil fuels could be sitting on <a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/faqs/what-are-stranded-assets/"">̢'��stranded assets'</a>, as demand for fossil fuels falls along the low-carbon transition. However, the risks (and opportunities) are not just confined to coal mining, oil and gas production. Rather they affect a host of other sectors of the economy, including energy-intensive manufacturing industries such as iron and steel, and cement, as well as transportation.<h3>Doing so requires more disclosure and accessible tools</h3>For investors, transparent and accurate information on how the companies they are investing in are moving towards a low-carbon economy is therefore essential, which is why a number of international initiatives are underway to improve the quality of such information, notably the <a href=""https://www.fsb-tcfd.org/"">FSB Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures</a>.<a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi"">The TPI</a> is intended to contribute to this improvement in the information base, with a particular emphasis on asset owners' investment decisions and engagement activities. Many data providers and initiatives hold information on companies' progress to reduce carbon emissions, but the TPI's framework is intended to bring that progress to life in a way that is easy to understand, open to all and that can inform engagement.<h3>Results so far</h3>The first set of results, released in January 2017, assessed how the world's 20 largest companies by market capitalisation in both the oil and gas, and electricity utilities, sectors are managing their carbon emissions.Using data from FTSERussell, the data partner for the TPI, companies are scored on a scale of 0-4: companies on level 0 are unaware of or not acknowledging climate change as a significant issue for the business, while companies on level 4 have progressed all the way to making a strategic assessment of climate change, by for example setting long-term, quantitative targets for reducing carbon emissions. All the data used to make the assessments are sourced from public disclosures by companies.&nbsp;<img class=""size-full wp-image-398 aligncenter"" src=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tpi1-1.jpg"" alt="""" width=""700"" height=""291"" /><h3>Most companies recognise climate change as a risk - but there's room for improvement</h3>Out of the 40 companies assessed, only one is on level 0, i.e. it does not provide any acknowledgement of climate change as a business issue. All other companies are at least acknowledging climate change as a business issue.But few of the companies assessed are at the top of the scoreboard (7 out of 40 are placed on level 4), so most companies still have room for improvement.The typical company (15 out of 40) is at level 2, which is described as ̢'��building capacity'. These companies explicitly recognise climate change as a significant issue for the business, have a policy commitment to action, have some form of carbon emissions reduction target and disclose their direct emissions and emissions from bought electricity (so-called Scope 1 and 2 emissions).The most common factors stopping companies progressing to level 4 are that they have not set quantitative targets for reducing operational carbon emissions (26 out of 40 haven't) and that they have not had operational emissions data verified (22 out of 40 haven't).<h3>Electricity utilities score slightly better than oil and gas producers as a whole</h3>The analysis shows that electricity utilities are marginally more advanced in managing carbon emissions than oil and gas producers. Though, as with the oil and gas sector, more electricity utilities are building capacity (i.e. are on level 2) than are on any other level, there are relatively more level 3 and 4 electricity utilities. In comparison, there are relatively more oil and gas producers on levels 0 and 1, at the bottom of the scoreboard.Few oil and gas producers have set energy or carbon emissions reduction targets (only 5 of 20 have) and only 2 out of 20 oil and gas producers provide information on the business costs associated with climate change, compared with 8 out of 20 electricity utilities.<strong>'�</strong><strong>Electricity utilities</strong><strong><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-399"" src=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tpi2.png"" alt="""" width=""700"" height=""255"" />'�</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Oil and gas producers</strong><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-400"" src=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/tpi3.png"" alt="""" width=""700"" height=""273"" /><strong>'�</strong><h3>The next steps</h3><a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi"">The TPI</a> will publish more results later this year, covering a wider range of sectors and testing whether companies' current and planned future carbon emissions are aligned with the overall objectives of the Paris Agreement and the national pledges or Nationally Determined Contributions made to the Agreement.So far most of the companies that have been assessed have left the starting blocks, but there is room for improvement in managing transition risk from carbon emissions. <a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi"">The TPI</a> will help asset owners engage more with companies they are invested in to make sure they are well positioned for the move towards a low-carbon economy.&nbsp;<strong>'�</strong><strong>Simon Dietz and Victoria Druce</strong><em>Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment</em><em>LSE</em>",,early-analysis-tpi-toolkit-shows-companies-are-building-capacity-to-manage-transition-risk,http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/early-analysis-tpi-toolkit-shows-companies-are-building-capacity-to-manage-transition-risk/,Commentaries,,TPI,525,07/06/2017,European electricity utilities lead the way but more action needed to hit Paris pledges,"<h3>New funds join the Transition Pathway Initiative</h3>The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI), backed by Funds with over '3 trillion in assets under management, today launched its assessment of the carbon performance of the world's 20 largest electricity utilities by market capitalisation.

The results reveal:<ul> 	<li>While some companies '� e.g. Enel, Entergy, Iberdrola and SSE'� have set targets to reduce their emissions below 2 degrees, meeting the ambitions of the United Nations Paris Agreement, the greenhouse gas emissions from many others will not fall quickly enough to meet the overall aim of the Paris Agreement and thereby avoid dangerous climate change.</li> 	<li>The three European utilities are significantly less carbon-intensive than the 14 US utilities.

It also tells us that utility companies will need to significantly reorient their strategies and their capital expenditure plans if the sector is to remain below the global 2 Degrees benchmark.'<strong>Adam Matthews, Co-Chair of the Transition Pathway Initiative and Head of Engagement for the Church Commissioners and Church of England Pensions Board commented:</strong>'The results clearly show if we are to understand the risks and opportunities presented by the transition to a low carbon economy then investors need to focus on the future carbon performance of companies.It is encouraging that European utilities seem better placed to manage the transition. However, the message to policy makers remains clear that businesses need strong enabling regulatory environments to manage the transition. The gap between what governments agreed in Paris in 2015 and the 2 degree pathway remains significant. More needs to be done by governments to close that gap if we are to avoid dangerous climate change.'<strong>Helena Vi'es Fiestas, Head of Sustainability Research, BNP Paribas Asset Management commented that:</strong>""The latest TPI results tell us that we must pay close attention to current and future greenhouse gas emissions in our company engagement; we can see that good management practices and disclosures alone do not inevitably lead to superior performance.""The Transition Pathway Initiative is also delighted to announce that new funds had joined the 13 founding members. Joining the asset managers supporting TPI Legal and General Investment Management (LGIM), and Inflection Point Capital Management (IPCM) and their sister company La Francaise Inflection Point (LFIP). The AUM of funds supporting the initiative is now over '3 trillion / $3.8 trillion.<strong>Meryam Omi, Head of Sustainability at LGIM said:</strong>'We are delighted to support the Transition Pathway Initiative (̢'��TPI'), which allows a common tool to be utilised by asset owners in their assessment of climate and energy transition risks in their portfolios.

We welcome the TPI for its rigor and transparency. IPCM and LFIP have long held the belief that to uncover a company's true management quality, you need to systematically take into account various non-traditional factors, including environmental sustainability, and how those factors impact the company's risk management and value drivers going forward.'&nbsp;<strong>ENDS</strong>&nbsp;<h3>CONTACT</h3>Mark Arena, Head of Financial Communications<a href=""mailto:mark.arena@churchofengland.org"">mark.arena@churchofengland.org</a>020 7898 1221 / 07949933714&nbsp;<h3>NOTES TO EDITORS</h3>1.1. The Transition Pathway InitiativeThe TPI is a global, asset owner-led initiative, supported by asset owners and managers with over '3 trillion of assets under management. The initiative assesses how companies are preparing for the transition to a low-carbon economy. The analysis is in two parts:1. Management Quality: TPI evaluates and tracks the quality of companies' management of their greenhouse gas emissions and of risks and opportunities related to the low carbon transition. Companies are assigned to one of five levels, from level 0 ('Unaware of, or not Acknowledging, Climate Change as a Business Issue') to level 4 ('Strategic Assessment'), based on how they perform against 14 criteria.2. Carbon Performance: TPI also evaluates how companies' recent and future carbon performance might compare to the international targets and national pledges made as part of the Paris Agreement. It is the results of this part of the analysis that we cover in this report. TPI publishes the results of its analysis through an open online tool hosted by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics (LSE).TPI was launched in January 2017 with management quality assessments of the global top 20 companies by market capitalisation in each of the electricity utilities, and oil and gas, sectors (i.e. a total of 40 companies).1 This report therefore marks the addition of carbon performance data for the 20 electricity utilities. Further sectors and companies will be added over the course of 2017 and beyond.The funds supporting TPI have committed to use the results in a number of different ways, including informing their investment decision-making, engagement with companies, and dialogue with fund managers and policy makers.",,european-electricity-utilities-lead-the-way-but-more-action-needed-to-hit-paris-pledges,http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/european-electricity-utilities-lead-the-way-but-more-action-needed-to-hit-paris-pledges/,Press Releases,,TPI,542,19/06/2017,An Asset Manager's Perspective on the Transition Pathway Initiative,"<em>Helena Vines Fiestas</em><em>Head of Sustainability Research at BNP Paribas Investment Partners</em>The Transition Pathway Initiative is a game-changing initiative for three reasons. First, it provides a robust, independent and academically rigorous framework for assessing how companies are managing the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their businesses, as well as how their strategies and targets align with the international target of maintaining a global temperature rise of below 2 degrees above pre-industrials levels.'� Critically, the methodology does not reinvent the wheel but builds on leading initiatives such as the investor expectation guidelines of the Institutional Investors Group on Climate Change (̢'��IIGCC'), to which we have been contributing since its inception.Second, it covers a large universe of companies: over 100 will be assessed in 2017 and many more in 2018, with all of the results and analysis being made publicly available. The value of the extensive coverage and of making this information available to all cannot be underestimated. Even major asset managers such as ourselves struggle to analyse in such detail such a large number of companies' climate strategies. With all of the analysis and data collection already done for us, we invest our resources in engaging with the companies to encourage improvement in those areas identified as weaker.Third, it is backed by and led by asset owners. Asset owners, despite their key role in the investment chain, have often been silent on climate change. This initiative changes that; it is a clear expression of what asset owners expect from companies and from their investment managers. This will cascade through the investment chain. It will certainly drive asset manager action. It will mean that companies are getting a clear and consistent message from all investors. It will enable us to better align our engagement with the needs and interests of our clients. And it will signal to policymakers that long-term fiduciary investors recognise and accept the risks presented by climate change, and the importance '� to these investors and to wider society '� of taking action.&nbsp;",,an-asset-managers-perspective-on-the-transition-pathway-initiative,http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/an-asset-managers-perspective-on-the-transition-pathway-initiative/,Commentaries,,TPI,544,19/06/2017,Enhancing long-term investment decision-making,"<strong>Liz Fernando, USS</strong>USS Investment Management is the in house manager for the Universities Superannuation Scheme, one of the UK's largest pension schemes.'� Of USS's ~ '60bn in assets, approximately '24bn is invested in public equities.'� The vast majority of this is managed actively:'� a team of analysts and fund managers choose the individual stocks in which we invest.As an active manager, we want to invest in companies where we have confidence in management to deliver a business model which is sustainable in the long term. This is an integral part of how we manage risk and central to how we deliver on our pensions promise.'� To make better investment decisions we need information about how the companies in which we could or do invest are managing all the material issues they face, and given our long time horizon this includes climate change.For any Board of directors overseeing a business which is expecting to remain in existence for the foreseeable future, the effective management of environmental, social and governance issues, including climate change is an unavoidable part of a company's licence to operate. We believe good management of these issues will drive better long term returns.'� More specifically, we expect companies to have a clear strategy aligned to the business objectives, clear KPIs to monitor the delivery of that strategy, and good reporting of what they are doing so that those outside the business can monitor progress. We proactively vote to support such disclosure.Notwithstanding recent events in the US we expect most countries to uphold their pledges under the Paris Agreement. Delivering these commitments will require changes in public policy and in regulation i.e. the cost and terms of doing business will change over time. Managing the transition to a low carbon economy should therefore be on corporate agendas.As a result, we are proud to be a supporter of the TPI.'� It will provide us with information on management quality and on performance, allowing us to assess companies' exposure to carbon and climate change risk and their management of that risk.'� At USS we will use the information to both inform investment decisions, and as a basis for our stewardship strategies with companies, either individually or in collaboration with other investors.'� The simple-to-follow escalation process provides specific improvements to ask for, and a mechanism to track the success of engagement.&nbsp;",,enhancing-long-term-investment-decision-making,http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/enhancing-long-term-investment-decision-making/,Commentaries,,TPI,555,27/06/2017,Latest results: electricity utilities need to be more ambitious to meet 2'C target,"The Transition Pathway Initiative, launched in January 2017, analyses how companies are preparing for the transition to a low-carbon future. The initiative supports asset owners in their investment decision-making, engagement with companies, and dialogues with fund managers and policy makers.The latest analysis from the Initiative reveals that a majority of the world's top 20 electricity utilities are currently aligned with emissions targets set out in the Paris Agreement. However, the analysis also shows that not enough utilities have set targets for their future emissions, and not enough of the targets that have been set are aligned with keeping global warming below 2'C.<h3>New TPI results assess how well electricity utilities are cutting carbon emissions</h3>There is a'�<a href=""https://www.ft.com/content/01e2bfb6-f1d1-11e5-aff5-19b4e253664a"">growing need</a>'�amongst investors to better understand how the transition to a low-carbon economy could affect their portfolios. The'�<a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi"">Transition Pathway Initiative</a>'�(TPI), established by the Church of England National Investing Bodies and the Environment Agency Pension Fund, assesses how companies are performing in relation to the transition to a low-carbon economy. It enables investors to scrutinise companies' management of carbon emissions and track their performance in reducing emissions.The first set of results from the TPI, '�published in January this year, found that the world's largest 20 companies in each of the oil and gas, and electricity utilities, sectors are building capacity to manage the low-carbon transition, but few have integrated carbon into operational decision-making, let alone assessing the issue strategically.The second set of results, published this month, analyses how well the world's top 20 electricity utilities are performing in cutting their carbon emissions and whether the targets they have in place match up to targets set out under the Paris Agreement.<h3>Global carbon budgets set out the pathway towards Paris Agreement targets</h3>The TPI assessment of carbon performance uses global carbon budgets as a starting point. These budgets are estimated by climate scientists and set out how much carbon can be emitted cumulatively over time while keeping global warming to a target level, e.g. 2'C. The TPI team has used modelling from the International Energy Agency to translate the global carbon budget into emissions pathways for different regions and different economic sectors, including electricity.The TPI analyses the carbon emissions intensity of companies against two benchmarks: a '2'C scenario' consistent with the overall aim of the Paris Agreement; and a 'Paris Pledges scenario' consistent with the emissions reductions pledged by signatories to the Paris Agreement in the form of 'Nationally Determined Contributions'. The NDCs combined are currently insufficient to limit warming to 2'C, although the Paris Agreement is designed around them being ratcheted up over time.The carbon emissions intensity of electricity utilities is calculated as their greenhouse gas emissions per unit of electricity generated. The TPI estimated it using public disclosures of current emissions and electricity generation, and companies' stated future emissions targets. Two of the companies in the global top 20 made insufficient disclosures to be included in the analysis, leaving 18 in the sample.<h3>Electricity utilities need to accelerate the pace of decarbonisation after 2020 to align with 2'C benchmark</h3><img class=""aligncenter size-full wp-image-526"" src=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/figure1.jpg"" alt=""Figure 1: Emissions intensity paths for companies with targets"" width=""700"" height=""479"" />Between 2013 and 2015, the emissions intensity of 12 out of the 18 utilities that the TPI looked at was low enough to be aligned with the benchmarks, including the pathway to keep global warming below 2'C. The average emissions intensity of all 18 utilities was also better than the benchmarks between 2013 and 2015.The remaining 6 out of 18 companies are currently more carbon-intensive than either the 2'C benchmark or the Paris Pledges benchmark. They are: American Electric Power Co., CLP Holdings, DTE Energy, Eversource Energy, Fortis Inc. and XCEL Energy.<h3>Five utilities are aligned with the 2'C target in 2020</h3>Only half of the 18 companies have targets for 2020. '�Of those 9, assuming that all companies meet their targets, 5 will be less carbon-intensive than the benchmarks in 2020, while the remaining 4 will be more carbon-intensive than either the 2'C benchmark or the Paris Pledges benchmark.The average emissions intensity of the 9 companies with targets is below both benchmarks in 2020.<h3>Only 2 utilities are aligned with the 2'C target in 2030</h3>Just 6 of the 18 companies currently have targets for emissions reductions that extend to 2030.Of those, 2 will be more carbon-intensive than both benchmarks and 2 will be on track to meet the Paris Pledges target.Only 2 companies aim to cut their emissions in line with the pathway which will to limit global warming to 2'C. They are Enel and Iberdrola.<h3>US utilities are decarbonising more slowly than European utilities, but European utilities face tougher regulation</h3>The team also analysed how electricity utilities are performing based on their location, taking into account differences between countries' NDCs to the Paris Agreement, as well as how efforts to limit global warming to 2'C might be distributed around the world.Fourteen of the world's top 20 electricity utilities are based in the US, 1 in Canada, 3 in Europe and 2 in Hong Kong.The European utilities are significantly less carbon-intensive than the North American utilities on average; all 3 are aligned with the global 2'C benchmark now and in the future. Some North American utilities have very low carbon intensity, but they are outweighed by others whose carbon intensity is very high.The European utilities do not perform as well against European benchmarks, however. These benchmarks are markedly tougher than the global benchmarks. Only one company, the Spanish utility Iberdrola, is aligned with the European 2'C benchmark and by 2030 even it is out of alignment.<h3>The next steps '� beyond the power sector</h3>For now, most of the electricity utilities analysed in this latest set of results are aligned with low-carbon benchmarks, but many will need to step up their efforts in the future. More than half of the global top 20 still have not set targets that pin down their emissions in 2020 or 2030 and some will need to tighten the targets they do have.The new results, in combination with earlier analysis of how well companies are strategically managing the transition to a low-carbon future, provide assets owners with objective information for investment decisions and engagement.The next steps for the TPI will be to move beyond oil and gas, and power. Data releases are planned in the coming months for the global top 20 companies in each of the coal mining, cement and steel sectors.<strong>Simon Dietz and Victoria Druce</strong><em>Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment</em><em>LSE</em>&nbsp;",,latest-results-electricity-utilities-need-to-be-more-ambitious-to-meet-2c-target,http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/latest-results-electricity-utilities-need-to-be-more-ambitious-to-meet-2c-target/,Commentaries,,TPI,567,17/07/2017,New research shows specialist coal mining companies falling short in their ability to manage carbon emissions,"Many of the world's leading coal mining companies are failing to manage effectively the business risks arising from climate change, according to a new report from the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI).The TPI is backed by asset owners and investors with over '4 trillion ($5.2 trillion) of assets under management. <a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpithe-toolkit/"">The assessment of companies' carbon emissions management</a> is carried out by the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment and supported by data from FTSE Russell.The latest assessment, which follows earlier ones on electricity utilities and oil and gas companies, evaluated the management policies and processes of the world's 20 largest coal mining companies.

We have made four major changes that will enable the <a href=""http://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org"">Transition Pathway Initiative</a> to align its Level 0 to 4 Management Quality indicators with the TCFD's recommendations:<ol> 	<li>We have updated our categorisation of sectors to reflect carbon emissions normalised by revenue. We now have three categories '� primary impact (e.g. airlines, integrated oil and gas, paper), secondary impact (e.g. food products, hotels, transportation services) and tertiary impact (e.g. apparel retailers, medical supplies, software). While we acknowledge that there may be companies in the lower impact sectors that have higher carbon emissions (and vice versa in the higher impact sectors), this provides an effective categorisation of companies and aligns carbon impact with FTSE Russell's wider approach to sectoral classification (ICB).</li> 	<li>We have added seven new indicators that speak directly to the changes proposed by the TCFD. These are:<ul> 	<li>The recognition of climate change as a relevant risk and/or opportunity to the business, and the timeframe over which this is assessed.</li> 	<li>How climate-related risks and opportunities are incorporated into strategy (mitigation, new products, R&amp;D, etc.) and capital allocated (OPEX, CAPEX, M&amp;A, debt).</li> 	<li>Whether the company has conducted climate scenario analysis and described the business impacts of one or more climate scenarios.</li> 	<li>Exploration and production intensity as measured in GHG emissions per barrel of oil equivalent (for exploration and production, and integrated oil and gas).</li> 	<li>Refining intensity as measured in GHG emissions per barrel of oil equivalent (for refineries and integrated oil and gas).</li> 	<li>Cement production GHG emissions intensity as measured in GHG emissions per tonne of cement/cementitious material (for cement).</li> 	<li>Scope 3 emissions (3 years) split by category type.</li></ul></li> 	<li>We have extended the coverage of 3 indicators to companies in tertiary impact (or low impact) sectors. These are the indicators relating to whether operational GHG emissions are independently verified, whether the intensity of operational GHG emissions has reduced, and whether operational energy consumption data are independently verified.</li> 	<li>We have started to collect data on sector-specific emissions and performance for companies in the oil and gas, electric utility, cement, real estate, metals and mining, chemicals, steel, food producers, paper and forest products, agricultural products, beverages, agriculture and asset owner/asset manager sectors. For example, in the oil and gas sector, we collect information on oil and gas production by hydrocarbon (oil, gas, oil sands), reserve replacement ratios (RRR), production cost by hydrocarbon (oil, gas, oil sands), flaring emissions (CO<sub>2</sub>e) and methane emissions (CH<sub>4</sub>).</li></ol>These enhancements will allow us to more accurately assess the quality of companies' climate change disclosures and performance, the impact of climate change on companies' strategy, and the quality of the scenario analysis being conducted by companies. We have started to apply these indicators across the full universe of over 4,000 companies covered by our ESG research, and expect to have completed a full cycle of this research (i.e. assessed all companies using these new indicators) by June 2018.Prepared by: Charles Fruitiere (ESG Analyst, FTSE Russell) and Dr Rory Sullivan (Head of ESG Standards, FTSE Russell and Expert Advisor, Transition Pathway Initiative).<hr /><strong>TPI Commentary:</strong>We have worked closely with FTSE Russell as it has gone through the process of revising its climate change indicators. The revisions will enable us to further align our Level 0 to 4 management quality framework with the TCFD's recommendations and also enable us to conduct more sophisticated and robust analysis on some of our existing indicators.FTSE Russell has presented these changes to the TPI's Technical Advisory Group and we are now reviewing and revising the TPI's indicators. Without pre-empting this work, our ambition is:<ul> 	<li>To have clear alignment between the TPI and the TCFD's recommendations.</li> 	<li>To introduce sector-specific indicators to complement the existing Management Quality indicators.</li> 	<li>To introduce a new Level 5 (or extended Level 4) that fully assesses companies' ability to strategically manage the transition to a low-carbon economy. We see this as providing us with an explicit link between our Management Quality indicators and our Carbon Performance assessments.</li></ul>We have also started to develop proposals on how we might assess the quality of companies' scenario analysis, in conjunction with FTSE Russell, TPI supporters and other stakeholders. We will offer suggestions on general, high-level indicators that may be adopted by FTSE Russell (e.g. does the company publish a scenario analysis? Does it document its assumptions? Does it identify its central scenario?), as well as on a more detailed framework that may be used to analyse individual scenario analyses.<strong>Professor Simon Dietz, 20<sup>th</sup> September 2017</strong>",,683-2,http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/683-2/,Commentaries,,TPI,794,27/09/2017,Steel and cement companies falling short in transition to low-carbon economy,"New research by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) on the cement and steel sectors shows that few of the largest companies in these sectors are well prepared for the transition to a low-carbon economy. This echoes previous research by the TPI on the coal-mining, electricity, and oil and gas sectors.The TPI is backed by asset owners and investors with over '4 trillion ($5.2 trillion) of assets under management. The assessment of companies' carbon emissions management and performance is carried out by the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, and supported by data from FTSE Russell.Two reports, launched today at the PRI in Person conference in Berlin, examine how the world's 20 largest companies in the cement and steel sectors are managing climate change risks and opportunities, and how their emissions performance compares to international benchmarks for the sectors. They follow reports released earlier this year on electricity utilities, oil and gas companies, and coal-mining companies. The findings show that:<ul> 	<li>Most companies now publicly acknowledge climate change as a significant business issue.</li> 	<li>But only a minority of companies have integrated climate change into operational decision-making and only around one out of every eight companies in cement and steel are looking at the issue strategically.</li> 	<li>The steel sector is lagging behind other sectors whose carbon management quality has been assessed by TPI so far.</li> 	<li>Among the best prepared companies are LafargeHolcim in cement and Acerinox in steel. These companies score highly on carbon management quality, and they have low carbon emissions intensity, below their sector benchmarks.</li> 	<li>There is a lack of consistent disclosure of carbon emissions in the cement and steel sectors. The cement sector has developed reporting guidelines, but a number of the largest companies do not yet follow them. Disclosures are particularly inconsistent in the steel sector.</li> 	<li>Very few companies have set targets to reduce their carbon emissions beyond 2020, making it difficult for investors to understand whether cement and steel emissions will be reduced in line with international targets.</li></ul>&nbsp;Commenting on the study, Professor Simon Dietz, Co-Director of the London School of Economics Grantham Research Institute, said: <em>'These findings for the cement and steel sectors reinforce our earlier conclusions that, while there are some star performers, most companies still have a long way to go to be well-prepared for the transition to a low-carbon economy.'</em>Faith Ward, Co-Chair of the Transition Pathway Initiative and Chief Responsible Investment and Risk Officer for the Environment Agency Pension Fund, said: <em>'Investors need assurance that companies are taking the transition to a 2-degree world seriously, and these reports shine a light on those companies that are failing to do that. We will be studying these reports closely and looking for progress from the companies that have the most work to do in the months ahead.'</em>Adam Matthews, Co-Chair of the Transition Pathway Initiative and Head of Engagement for the Church Commissioners and Church of England Pensions Board, said: <em>'This research suggests that companies in the cement and steel sectors are exposed to significant regulatory risks associated with the transition to a low carbon economy, and that they are not managing these risks effectively.'</em>It was also announced today that Generation Investment Management are joining the Transition Pathway Initiative. David Blood, Co-Founder and Senior Partner of Generation Investment Management said: <em>'Generation is delighted to support the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI).'�We consider it a valuable tool for asset owners and managers as we invest together in the transition to a low carbon economy.'</em>&nbsp;<strong>ENDS</strong><h3>Download reports</h3><a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Steel-combined-report-21-Sept.pdf"">Management quality and carbon performance of steel makers: a commentary</a> '� 27 September 2017<a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Cement-combined-report-21-Sept.pdf"">Management quality and carbon performance of cement producers: a commentary</a> '� 27 September 2017&nbsp;<strong>Notes</strong>The TPI is a global, asset owner-led initiative, supported by asset owners and managers with over '4 trillion ($5.2 trillion) of assets under management.

This research shows parts of the industry taking their impact on the climate seriously, and we all know about some potentially world changing examples of innovation in this area. However, corporate disclosures on climate change, carbon management and performance are weak. Investors need robust, comparable data and too many car companies remain opaque.'</em>Euan Stirling, Global Head of Stewardship and ESG Investing, Aberdeen Standard Investments said:<em>'The TPI toolkit is a really useful, and free, resource for investors. It covers some of the most environmentally-sensitive sectors and the recently-published automotive and paper industry analyses highlight the need for this type of independent and objective research.

Progress is related to implementing new carbon management practices, such as explicitly recognising climate change as a business risk / opportunity, and setting emissions reduction targets.</li> 	<li>Of the 37 electricity utilities assessed, 26 have targets extending to at least 2020, but only 19 have targets encompassing 2030. Of these, over half are projected to be aligned with at least the Paris Pledges in 2020, and most of these also align with a Below 2 Degrees scenario.</li> 	<li>Only 5 of the electricity companies - E.ON, EDF, Enel, Iberdrola and SSE - are aligned with Below 2 Degrees by 2030.</li> 	<li>In the oil and gas and mining sectors, very few companies have set emissions targets reduction targets for the carbon emissions from the use of coal, oil and gas in buildings, electricity generation, industry and transport.</li></ul>Emma Howard Boyd, Chair of the Environment Agency, said:'It's heartening to see many companies have implemented a wide range of carbon management practices, but it is concerning that companies are yet to align their business strategies with the goals of the Paris Agreement. On current trajectories, global temperature rise is expected to exceed 2'C by 2100, and a 3 to 4'C rise is likely. If investors are to have confidence risks are managed appropriately we need to see more on resilience to the physical threats of climate change in addition to better carbon management.'Adam Matthews, Co-Chair of the Transition Pathway Initiative and Director of Engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board, said: 'Today's report identifiers that Increasing numbers of electricity utilities are making the transition to renewable energy.

The assessment of companies' carbon management and performance is carried out by the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, supported by data from FTSE Russell.Two reports, launched today, examine how the world's largest publicly listed companies in the cement and steel sectors are managing climate change risks and opportunities, and how their emissions performance compares to international climate goals. These reports update assessments of the cement and steel sectors published in September 2017. The findings show that:<ul> 	<li>Companies in these sectors tend to be building capacity on managing climate change, but are yet to integrate the issue into operational decision-making. A sizeable minority still do not disclose their emissions, or have not set any form of target to reduce their emissions.</li> 	<li>While several companies have progressed since 2017, implementing new practices to manage carbon emissions, other companies are falling back - overall there is little change on last year's assessment.</li> 	<li>The steel sector remains the lowest performing sector assessed by TPI so far on carbon management.</li> 	<li>There is a lack of consistent disclosure of carbon emissions in the cement and steel sectors. The cement sector has developed reporting guidelines, but a number of the largest companies do not yet follow them. Disclosures are particularly inconsistent in the steel sector.</li> 	<li>Very few companies have set targets to reduce their carbon emissions beyond 2020, making it difficult for investors to understand whether cement and steel emissions will be reduced in line with international targets.</li></ul>Commenting on the study, Professor Simon Dietz of the London School of Economics Grantham Research Institute, said:'�<em>'While we see that some companies have made progress, and some examples of good practice, overall the assessment looks very similar to last year.

These emissions account for the largest share of these companies' lifecycle emissions, often accounting for over 80% of a company's carbon emissions footprint.The new insights demonstrate some positive progress from the sector, with Shell and Total recently reporting ambitions to reduce not only their operationalemissions, but also emissions from their value chains. This brings their ambitions in line with the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pledges made by Governments at the Paris Agreement in 2015 '� though still not enough for what scientists say is required to keep global warming below 2'C (nor 1.5'C) by 2050.Of the other eight companies, five '� <strong>Chevron, EOG Resources, Exxon Mobil, Occidental and Reliance Petroleum</strong>'� do not have any quantitative emissions reduction targets. The remaining three '� <strong>Eni, BP </strong>and <strong>ConocoPhillips </strong>'� only have targets covering operational emissions (Scope 1 and 2), which would see their future carbon intensity remain significantly above that required to meet the Paris pledges.No company has proposed to reduce its carbon intensity sufficiently to be aligned with a Below 2 Degrees benchmark or to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.

We welcome Shell and Total's leadership in setting out their ambitions.'� We note that while they are moving in the right direction, and are ahead of their peers, this study suggests they are not yet ambitious enough to align with a pathway to below 2 degrees of warming by 2050.' </em><em>'Targets that cover all of a company's emissions, from production to use of their sold products, provide a transparent basis for asset owners to engage with oil and gas companies on their strategies to transition.'</em><strong>Emma Howard Boyd</strong>, Chair of the Environment Agency and Chair of the Environment Agency Pension Fund Investment Committee, said:<em>'The UK Government has asked the Committee on Climate Change to review whether legally binding carbon targets are compatible with limiting temperature increases to 1.5'C above pre-industrial levels. The IPCC report shows even if we manage that we still face an exponential rise in physical impacts, like flood, drought, and the spread of disease. Corporate Boards, especially those in the oil and gas sector, need to get ahead of this or they are taking an unrecoverable risk with their companies' future.'</em><strong>Dr Rory Sullivan</strong>, one of the papers co-authors and Chief Advisor to TPI said:<em>'</em><em>In this paper, we have set out a series of expectations that should inform investors and others engaging with these companies.

TPI evaluates what the transition to a low-carbon economy looks like for companies in key energy intensive sectors with a high impact on climate change, such as automotive, mining, electricity generation, oil and gas, and steel. It also assesses how well-prepared companies in these sectors are for the low-carbon transition.TPI is supported by: Aberdeen Standard Investments, Aviva Investors, BNP Paribas Asset Management, Brunel Pension Partnership, CalPERS, CCLA, Central Finance Board of the Methodist Church, The Church Commissioners for England, Church of England Pensions Board, The Church in Wales, Electron Capital Partners, Environment Agency Pension Fund, AP Fonden, Generation, GMPF, Hermes investment management, Legal &amp; General investment management, Local Authority pension Fund Forum, LPP, Northern Pool, OP Trust, PGGM, Representative church body of the Church of Ireland, RPMI Railpen, Robeco, Ruffer, Schroders, AP3, UBS, Union investment, USS, Wellington Investment Management, Wespath, West Midlands Pension Fund",,new-research-shows-only-two-large-oil-gas-companies-have-long-term-low-carbon-ambitions,http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/new-research-shows-only-two-large-oil-gas-companies-have-long-term-low-carbon-ambitions/,Press Releases,,TPI,2261,19/11/2018,The state of climate action by high-carbon global corporations,"The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) has today published a synthesis of the state of climate action by high-carbon global corporations in the leading climate change journal <em>Nature Climate Change</em> (<a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0343-2"">http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41558-018-0343-2</a>).The article assesses the patterns of corporate carbon management and emissions performance across the 138 companies that were in the TPI database as of June 2018. It also looks at how corporate carbon management and emissions performance correlate with key features of those 138 companies such as their size, region of headquartering and sector.Looking across a range of carbon management practices, it is clear that overall progress on corporate management of carbon emissions is mixed. While a majority of companies has taken initial steps, including publishing a policy to act, disclosing operational and some value-chain emissions, and setting some form of energy/emissions target, only a minority has taken the more advanced steps, such as setting long-term emissions targets, or assigning boardroom responsibility for climate change.There are some interesting findings in the details of the data:<ul> 	<li>Automobile manufacturers and electricity utilities implement the most carbon management practices, while coal-mining companies and steel makers implement the fewest.</li> 	<li>Companies with a large market cap implement more carbon management practices than medium and small companies.</li> 	<li>Companies headquartered in Western Europe and to a lesser extent the Industrialised Asia-Pacific region do more than companies headquartered in emerging markets and in North America.</li> 	<li>Region and size appear to matter more than sector.</li></ul>The paper also looks at corporate carbon emissions performance. Two results stand out. First, there is limited robust, comparable information on current or future emissions. Twenty eight per cent of companies considered do not disclose their historical emissions and activity/production in a comparable form. Secondly, where companies do provide information on their targets, a large share of company targets are aligned with the Paris Agreement NDCs and with the overall objective of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 2'C. Companies headquartered in Western Europe have more ambitious targets on average.While there appears to be no relationship between companies' current carbon management quality and their current emissions performance, companies that have implemented more carbon management practices today are more likely to have set 2'C-aligned targets. That is, good carbon management today may be tied to better emissions performance in the future. This implies that investors should focus on getting companies to set long-term corporate targets, and should ensure that companies have robust carbon management practices to ensure that these targets are delivered.<strong>About TPI</strong>The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global initiative led by asset owners and supported by asset managers who collectively account for over '8.2 trillion (US$10.7 trillion) of assets under management.

The assessment of companies' carbon management and performance is carried out by the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, supported by data from FTSE Russell.The new data are an update of TPI assessments of the autos and paper sectors published in February 2018. The findings from the assessment of 21'�automobile manufacturers and 18 paper companies show that:<ul> 	<li>Autos is one of the highest performing sectors that TPI has assessed on carbon Management Quality, second only to electricity. The average company in this sector is at the stage of integrating climate change into operational decision-making, having set emissions reduction targets and disclosed operational (i.e. Scope 1 and 2) carbon emissions.</li> 	<li>However, six auto manufacturers still either do not acknowledge climate change as a business issue in their public disclosures, or have not progressed beyond mere acknowledgement. This list includes Tesla, which, while only producing electric vehicles, does not currently provide investors with any disclosures of its carbon management practices.</li> 	<li>The paper sector continues to be an average performer on carbon Management Quality, similar to other high-carbon manufacturing sectors like cement and steel.</li> 	<li>Very few companies in either sector have incorporated climate risks and opportunities into corporate strategy or undertake climate scenario planning, two key elements of good climate governance emphasised by the FSB Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).</li> 	<li>Most automobile manufacturers' fleets are currently too emissions-intensive to be aligned with the Paris Agreement goals. More than half of auto makers do not have fleet emissions targets extending to 2020 or beyond, and those without targets have higher fleet emissions today. However, of the 10 manufacturers with fleet emissions targets extending to 2020, most will be aligned with the Paris Agreement goals in some form.</li> 	<li>Six of the world's largest publicly listed paper producers do not provide sufficient disclosures for their emissions intensity to be calculated. However, most of those who do provide adequate disclosures start aligned with the Paris Agreement goals, including International Paper, by far the biggest company in the sector.</li> 	<li>In 2020, 6 out of the 8 paper producers with targets are aligned with the Paris Agreement in some form; 4 are aligned with a Below 2 Degrees benchmark.</li></ul>Commenting on the study, Professor Simon Dietz of the London School of Economics Grantham Research Institute, said: 'We see some examples of good practice in both of these sectors, but there is a shortage of long-term emissions targets, which deprives investors of a clear signal of company direction on climate change. It is also interesting to see how much companies still have to do to be in line with the disclosure recommendations of the TCFD.'<strong>For additional detail:</strong><ul> 	<li><a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MQ-and-CP-of-automobile-manufacturers-26-Nov-18.pdf"">Detailed presentation of TPI findings from the autos sector</a></li> 	<li><a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Methodology-note-automobiles-November-2018.pdf"">Detailed TPI assessment methodology of the autos paper</a></li></ul><ul> 	<li><a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MQ-and-CP-of-paper-and-pulp-producers-26-Nov-18.pdf"">Detailed presentation of TPI findings from the paper sector</a></li> 	<li><a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/TPI-Methodology-Note-Pulp-and-Paper-November-18.pdf"">Detailed TPI assessment methodology of the paper sector</a></li></ul>&nbsp;",,new-research-by-the-transition-pathway-initiative-on-automobile-manufacturers-and-paper-companies,http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/new-research-by-the-transition-pathway-initiative-on-automobile-manufacturers-and-paper-companies/,Press Releases,,TPI,2553,18/01/2019,Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) appoints Nadine Viel Lamare as Director in newly created role,"[caption id=""attachment_2555"" align=""alignright"" width=""207""]<img class=""size-medium wp-image-2555"" src=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NadineVielLamare-207x300.jpg"" alt="""" width=""207"" height=""300"" /> <em>Nadine Viel Lamare</em>[/caption]The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) has announced today the appointment of Ms Nadine Viel Lamare in a newly created role as Director of the TPI.'� In her role she will be responsible for the ongoing development and expansion of TPI, the leading online tool that assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy.Nadine will be responsible for managing TPI's key relationships and to represent TPI externally as the initiative continues to gather support from asset owners and asset managers. Recent members include NBIM and Willis Towers Watson which takes TPI's support to over $13 trillion in assets under management.

New data, launched today by the Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI), examine how the world's largest publicly listed companies involved in producing aluminium are managing climate change risks and opportunities, and how their emissions performance compares to international climate goals.TPI is backed by asset owners and investors with over '10.3 trillion ($13.3 trillion) of assets under management. The assessment of companies' carbon management and performance is carried out by the London School of Economics' Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, supported by data from FTSE Russell.The findings show that:<ul> 	<li>The 12 aluminium producers assessed are at various steps on the TPI Management Quality staircase, from acknowledging climate change as a business issue to strategic assessment. As a whole, the sector's Management Quality is close to the average of all companies in the TPI database. However, the 12 aluminium producers perform better on average than other carbon-intensive manufacturing sectors such as cement, paper and steel.</li> 	<li>All the leading companies in this sector are listed in OECD countries and several are diversified with majoroperations in other commodities such as mining. By contrast, more than half of global primary aluminium production is located in China.</li> 	<li>Carbon Performance data for the aluminium sector are limited. This reflects a lack of emissions disclosure of, and limited target-setting for, aluminium production specifically.</li> 	<li>Aluminium producers' emissions intensity varies widely, due mainly to the source of electricity used for smelting.</li> 	<li>Only 3 aluminium producers have an emissions intensity that is currently aligned with the Paris Agreement benchmarks: Alcoa, NorskHydro and Rio Tinto. NorskHydro's current emissions intensity is almost as low as the Below 2C benchmark in 2030.</li> 	<li>Only 2 companies have a target to reduce their emissions intensity of aluminium production that extends to at least 2020: Alcoa and UC Rusal.

Delta, United, Lufthansa and ANA Group (Japan) are the leaders on carbon management (<em>see full benchmark of ̢'��Management Quality' below</em>). Easyjet is the only airline with a CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions intensity of flights below the 2C benchmarks after 2020 (<em>see full benchmark of ̢'��Carbon Performance' below</em>). ANA Group, Japan Airlines, Korean Air and Singapore Airlines have the highest emissions intensities currently.Please note that, since this assessment was undertaken, there has been enhanced disclosure from Wizz Air on climate performance and therefore the company's Management Quality rating may not accurately reflect its most recent disclosures. Wizz Air also discloses a very low emissions intensity of flight operations, but TPI has been unable to verify this information so far.<strong>Faith Ward, Co-chair of the Transition Pathway Initiative on behalf of the Environment Agency Pension Fund, part of the Brunel Pension Partnership, said</strong><em>'Investors have a clear message to the aviation sector: When it comes to carbon performance they must be in it for the long haul. That means setting stretching emissions reduction targets to 2030 and beyond, and ending a reliance on offsetting. It's clear from TPI's research that this is not currently the case.' </em><em>'Offsetting is no substitute for a clear strategy to reduce emissions, and the IEA's carbon budget for air transport excludes the use of offsets. The aviation sector is doing the basics when it comes to carbon performance, but investors are urging them to take more significant steps as they judge which airlines are most likely to survive the turbulence of the transition to a low carbon economy. '</em><strong>Helena Vi'es Fiestas, Deputy Global Head of Sustainability at BNP Paribas Asset Management, said</strong><em>'The aviation industry clearly has a range of actions it can take to respond to climate change - improved energy efficiency, bio fuels, and offsetting amongst others.

It uses FTSE Russell data to analyse leading companies in 14 carbon-intensive sectors such as Oil and Gas, Electric Utilities, Automobiles, Airlines and Steel. These sectors account for 41% of global emissions from publicly listed companies worldwide. TPI is backed by investors with $14 trillion of assets including pension funds such as CalPERS and Environment Agency Pension Fund, and asset managers such as Legal &amp; General Investment Management, BNP Paribas, Aberdeen Standard and Robeco.

A new study of the climate performance of the energy sector from the $15 trillion investor-backed <a href=""http://www.transitionpathwayinitiative.org/"">Transition Pathway Initiative</a>(TPI) finds that '<em>climate progress in the energy sector is inching rather than accelerating towards a low-carbon future.' </em>The research is supported by investors including BNP Paribas Asset Management, Aberdeen Standard, Legal &amp; General Investment Management and Robeco.TPI assessed the carbon performance of 50 oil and gas companies and 59 electric utilities. Despite the claims of many oil and gas majors to be tackling climate change, TPI found that just <strong>two'�</strong>oil and gas companies have emissions ambitions in line with the Paris pledges made by national governments, and <strong>none'�</strong>are aligned with a pathway that would keep global warming to 2'C.The contrast with the electric sector is stark, with <strong>29'�</strong>electric utility companies (<strong>49%</strong>) now aligned with the Paris pledges, and over 20% set to meet the most ambitious ̢'��below 2'C' benchmark. (see graphic in notes to editor). <strong>EDF, E.ON, Exelon, Innogy</strong>, <strong>'�rsted'�</strong>and <strong>PG&amp;E'�</strong>are projected to reach nearly zero carbon by 2030.The TPI report also assessed carbon ̢'��Management Quality' - i.e. corporate governance of climate risk - for 135 leading oil &amp; gas, electric and coal mining firms. Coal is the worst performing sector on management quality. Fourteen coal companies (61%) fail on one of the most basic indicators '� that of explicitly recognising climate change as a relevant risk to their business. In total 29 of 135 energy firms (22%) fall into the bottom rankings (Level 0 and 1) for management quality of which 14 are in coal, 6 oil &amp; gas, and 9 electric utilities.For the 50 oil and gas companies assessed on carbon Management Quality the research finds:<ul> 	<li><strong>31'�</strong>(62%) oil and gas firms do not disclose Scope 3 emissions from the use of sold products (e.g. emissions from the cars or planes that use the firm's fuel) - including <strong>Exxon Mobil </strong>(US)and <strong>Gazprom'�</strong>(Russia).Scope 3 emissions are responsible for the vast majority (approximately 80%) of a company's carbon emissions footprint.</li> 	<li><strong>23</strong>(46%) have not set quantitative targets to reduce emissions, including <strong>Phillips 66'�</strong>(US) and <strong>Petrobras </strong>(Br)<strong>.</strong></li> 	<li><strong>26 (52%)</strong>have remained on the same level, 15 have moved up, and five have gone backwards.

We, as a major institutional investor, are concerned that transition risk - the large and growing gap between government targets and company ambitions - is a major source of investment risk.""'�</em><strong><em>Emma Howard Boyd, Chair of the UK Environment Agency and its Pension Fund Investment Committee:</em></strong><em>'�</em><em>'On Friday, people all over the world will take part in the climate strike calling on governments to act faster on the climate emergency.

There is no doubt that oil and gas companies are in a difficult position in navigating the transition to a low carbon economy. That makes it all the more important that we have at least some sector constituents who are starting to respond to the climate crisis by repositioning their businesses from the top down in the same way that many power generators have. The TPI reports highlight to the companies being assessed what can be done and should inspire those who are lagging to follow the climate transition leaders.'</em><em>'�</em><strong>Carola van Lamoen, Head of Active Ownership, Robeco:</strong><em>'TPI's research shows that there is significant room for improvement in the quality of management of climate-related issues by energy companies.

While all thirteen companies committed to achieving net zero direct emissions (those produced directly by the extraction of coal, oil or gas, or generation of electricity), only three pledged to eliminate indirect emissions (such as the emissions produced by generating the electricity used in their processes, or down the line from coal or gas extracted by the company, but burned by other firms).The research also finds:<ul> 	<li>just over half (54%) explicitly acknowledge the aims of the Paris Agreement to pursue efforts to limit global temperature rise to 1.5'C, but just 2 in 5 (39%) stated their support for these aims;</li> 	<li>only 1 in 5 (20%) explicitly acknowledge the need to reach net zero emissions.</li></ul>Many countries and businesses are committing to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions before 2050 in order to keep global heating well below 2'C above pre-industrial levels. Scientists last year said that any warming greater than 1.5'C 'increases the risk associated with long-lasting or irreversible changes' for the planet, and that global human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) need to reach net zero by around 2050. Reaching net zero involves reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and offsetting residual emissions that can't be reduced further, such as by planting trees.Energy supply and use account for around 72% of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2013, according to the Centre for Climate Energy Solutions.Professor Simon Dietz, Professor of Environmental Policy at the Grantham Research Institute, said:'Climate science tells us that net carbon dioxide emissions must fall to zero to stabilise global temperatures, and that limiting the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees requires global carbon dioxide emissions to reach net zero around 2050. Although new corporate net zero commitments are being made all the time, our analysis shows that we are starting from a very low base.'Professor Cameron Hepburn, Director of the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, at the University of Oxford, said:'Four years on from the signing of the Paris Agreement, our findings show that most of the world's largest energy companies have yet to develop plans compliant with one of its key goals: to eliminate net emissions of carbon dioxide over the next three decades. This exposes investors to significant financial risk as implementation of the Paris Agreement leads to polluting assets becoming stranded.'Adam Matthews, Co-Chair of Transition Pathway Initiative and Director of Ethics &amp; Engagement at Church of England Pensions Board, said:'This is important and much needed research that highlights the gap between what is needed to achieve 1.5 degrees and where current commitments from companies are at. While it's clear that the energy sector is far from where it should be on planning for net zero, the fact that we are beginning to assess these commitments, as well as letting companies know we are scrutinising their approach, will no doubt drive further company responses.'For more information about this media release please contact Kieran Lowe on +44 (0) 20 7107 5442 or <a href=""mailto:k.lowe@lse.ac.uk"">k.lowe@lse.ac.uk</a> or Bob Ward on +44 (0) 7811 320346 or <a href=""mailto:r.e.ward@lse.ac.uk"">r.e.ward@lse.ac.uk</a>.&nbsp;<strong>NOTES FOR EDITORS</strong><ol> 	<li>Data for the research was obtained from companies' public disclosures, including annual reports, sustainability reports and responses to the CDP questionnaire.

That may be the new buzzword that may help us keep the world from climate catastrophe, but few publicly listed companies in the energy sector have read the writing on the wall, with <a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/A-survey-of-the-net-zero-positions-of-the-worlds-largest-energy-companies.pdf"">new research</a> by TPI, the Grantham Institute and Oxford Martin School finding just one in ten committed to net zero in relation to their own emissions by 2050.In October 2018, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change outlined that to keep global temperature rises below 1.5 degrees would need a reduction in our net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. However this will require action at national, supranational and corporate level and quickly. At a national level, so far, 15 countries including the UK have agreed to aim for net zero, either by 2050 or sooner. In addition, a number of states and cities have made similar commitments, so that about a sixth of global GDP is covered.If governments follow through on this, they will soon be passing laws and regulation forcing the private sector to slash their emissions. This means well run companies should be formulating their medium-term strategy in the expectation of reaching a net zero scenario themselves.<h3>Regulatory risk</h3>Companies that fail to do this risk being overtaken by events; assuming governments take action, they will find their business model is no longer sustainable. Investors need to know which of these groups their portfolio companies belong to, so they can move their money or engage the companies to demand more commitment to a sustainable future.At the Transition Pathway Initiative, our role is ensuring investors have the information about corporate approaches to climate change to help inform their investment decisions. Using publicly disclosed data, TPI assesses how companies are aligning with a low-carbon future.We assess companies in two categories: Management Quality, their actual carbon emissions and their carbon emission targets. This is the first time we are have looked at data specifically on commitments to net zero in the energy sector.<h3>Net zero thinking in the energy sector</h3>This data shows that net zero thinking is still at a very early stage in the energy sector, including coal companies, electricity utilities and oil &amp; gas companies.So far, just 20% of the 132 companies we looked at had acknowledged the need for net global CO2 emissions to reach zero, and just 10%, 13 companies out of 132, had made net zero commitments in relation to their own emissions.This is perhaps unsurprising, given the slow progress TPI found in the sector earlier in the year. Just 28% of energy companies are aligned with the emission reduction pledges made by national governments in the Paris Agreement, a benchmark which itself falls well short of net zero.Companies with better governance of climate risk are more likely to have made a commitment to net zero, the report found. But even these companies have more to do. Although those high-scorers are now more transparent about the trade associations they belong to, none of them have made a commitment to ensure those trade associations' lobbying positions are aligned with their climate change policies.Since the next step on the road to net zero must involve alignment of regulation and corporate strategy, we must look for change here.<a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/A-survey-of-the-net-zero-positions-of-the-worlds-largest-energy-companies.pdf"">Read the report here</a>",,net-zero-thinking-failing-to-spark-in-the-energy-sector,http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/tpi/net-zero-thinking-failing-to-spark-in-the-energy-sector/,Commentaries,,TPI,
