<strong>-Bill</strong>

This law introduces two amendments to Sweden's Planning and Building Act (2010: 900): (1) Municipalities must assess the risk of damage to the built environment as a result of flood, erosion and climate-related risks, as well as how such risks may change in the future, and (2) Municipalities must offer a detailed plan when issuing a land permit for measures that may impair the land's permeability.

This law further adopts the Swedish National Climate Strategy into law. The National Climate Strategy concerns municipal land and water use, municipal development and preservation of the built environment, how municipalities intend to meet national climate targets and comply with environmental quality standards, how municipalities aim to consider the plan with respect to other national and regional objectives, how municipalities intend to accommodate long-term housing needs, and how municipalities will consider rural development in coastal zones.",SWE,"Residential and Commercial,Coastal zones,Water",Legislative,draft,"mitigation, adaptation",Law,Adaptation,""

GHG emissions are set to stop increasing at the latest by 2020-2025, to stabilise for up to 10 years and then to decline in absolute terms.<br />
<br />
Strategies are specified for the following areas:<br />
- Carbon Pricing<br />
- Water<br />
- Agriculture and commercial forestry<br />
- Health<br />
- Biodiversity and ecosystems<br />
- Human settlements<br />
- Disaster risk reduction and management<br />
<br />
The policy has two main objectives: first, to manage inevitable climate change impacts through interventions that build and sustain social, economic and environmental resilience and emergency response capacity. Secondly, to make a fair contribution to the global effort to stabilise GHG concentrations in the atmosphere.<br />
<br />
The Policy specifies strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation, making use of the short-, medium- and long-term planning horizons (up to five years from publication of policy, up to 20 years, up to 2050, respectively). The White Paper outlines a risk-based process to identify and prioritise adaptation strategies and interventions that have to be taken in the short and medium term, while reviewed every five years.<br />
<br />
Concerning mitigation, it includes proposals to set emission reduction outcomes for each significant sector and sub-sector of the economy based on an in-depth assessment of the mitigation potential, best available mitigation options and a full assessment of the costs and benefits using a 'carbon budgets' approach. It also proposed the deployment of a range of economic instruments, including the appropriate pricing of carbon and economic incentives, as well as the possible use of emissions offset or emission reduction trading mechanisms for those relevant sectors, sub-sectors, companies or entities where a carbon budget approach has been selected.<br />
<br />
Energy Efficiency and Energy and Demand Management flagship programmes cover development and facilitation of an aggressive energy efficiency programme in industry, building on previous Demand Side Management programmes, and covering non-electricity energy efficiency as well. A structured programme will be established with appropriate initiatives, incentives and regulation, along with a well-resourced information collection and dissemination process. Local governments are encouraged to take an active part in demand-side management.<br />
<br />
There is a short-term transportation flagship programme, which aims to facilitate the development of an enhanced public transportation programme to promote lower-carbon mobility in five metros and in ten smaller cities and create an Efficient Vehicles Programme with interventions that result in measurable improvements in the average efficiency of the vehicle fleet by 2020. The planned rail recapitalisation programme is considered an important component of this Flagship Programme due to its projected contribution to modal shifts of passengers and freight. The programme further introduces a Government Vehicle Efficiency Programme that will measurably improve the efficiency of the government vehicle fleet by 2020, by setting procurement objectives for efficient technology vehicles such as electric vehicles.<br />
<br />
In the medium term, the plan calls for significant up-scaling of energy efficiency applications in transportation; and for promoting transport-related interventions including transportation modal shifts (road to rail, private to public transport) and switches to alternative vehicles (e.g. electric and hybrid vehicles) and lower-carbon fuels.<br />
<br />
The principles of the White Paper include prioritising co-operation and the promotion of research, investment in and/or acquisition of adaptation, lower-carbon and energy-efficient technologies, practices and processes for employment by existing or new sectors or sub-sectors. All fields and flagship programmes include a key element of research and development, data collection and analysis tools in their respective areas.<br />
<br />
Adaptation efforts are prioritised, acknowledging the vulnerability of the country. Adaptation efforts will require: early warning and forecasting for disaster risk reduction; medium-term (decade-scale) climate forecasting to identify potential resource challenges well in advance; and long-term climate projections that define the range of future climate conditions. Adaptation strategies are to be integrated into sectoral plans, including: The National Water Resource Strategy, as well as reconciliation strategies for particular catchments and water supply systems; The Strategic Plan for South African Agriculture; The National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, as well as provincial biodiversity sector plans and local bioregional plans; The Department of Health Strategic Plan; The Comprehensive Plan for the Development of Sustainable Human Settlements; and the National Framework for Disaster Risk Management.<br />

Its objective is to guide a transition to a low carbon energy system, which provides secure supplies of competitive and affordable energy to our citizens and businesses. Ireland's energy policy addresses three core objectives: sustainability, security of supply, and competitiveness. It also addresses the need for affordable energy for domestic and business consumers.<br />
<br />
Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the energy sector will be reduced by between 80% and 95%, compared to 1990 levels, by 2050, and will fall to zero or below by 2100.<br />
Ireland's 2020 renewable energy target is to increase the share of national energy consumption made up of renewable energy sources (RES) to 16%. This target is broken into three key sectors with individual targets for each sector: 40% of electricity supply (RES-E), 12% of heating (RES-H), and 10% of transport (RES-T). Ireland also has a target of a 20% improvement in energy efficiency by 2020.<br />
Renewable energy and improved energy efficiency will play vital roles in reducing emissions. Decisions about the development and deployment of new technologies will inform the renewable energy mix and impact on the role of citizens as energy consumers.<br />
By 2030, the Better Energy Programme will deliver enough deep energy efficiency upgrades to put the residential sector on a realistic trajectory to a low carbon energy future.<br />
Consumers will drive the transition by, for example, choosing to use less energy, adopting lower carbon options for transport and heating shifting energy use to o -peak times or investing in smart home technologies.Stable, transparent, evidence-based, and independent regulation is essential to facilitate competition, to support investment, and to ensure that the cost of capital and network costs are minimised.<br />

To this end, the Policy adopts a comprehensive approach to address climate change, identifying as priority concerns: adaptation, mitigation, monitoring, and research. To address these concerns, the Policy promotes the implementation of activities relating to: education and increased awareness; gender issues; promoting and diffusing research; monitoring and transferring knowledge; and institutional capacity building.<br />
The policy calls for the adoption and implementation of a Transport Policy with emphasis on reducing GHG emissions from this sector, especially through the promotion of the use of less carbon intensive fuels. It also stresses the importance of the implementation of the 2007 Renewable Energy Policy and other measures that promote the use and the production of renewables.<br />

Its broad objectives are to create favourable conditions for meeting energy demand, increase energy security, reduce the impact of the energy sector on the environment, reduce the cost of energy production, integrate Ukraine's energy system into the European energy system, and strengthen Ukraine's position as an oil and gas transit nation. The Energy Strategy to 2030 calls for a 50% reduction in energy intensity by 2030.<br />
<br />
In 2013, the Cabinet approved an updated version of the Energy Strategy. Following the adoption and official publication of the Energy Strategy to 2030 the Ministry of Energy and Coal Industry is developing an Action Plan to implement the Strategy. The Action Plan will cover detailed measures to fulfil Ukraine's commitments taken in the framework of the treaty establishing the Energy Community.<br />
<br />
The Energy Strategy is designed to achieve the following results:<br />
- Fully cover growing electricity demand by retrofitting thermal power plants; increasing the life cycle of existing nuclear power plants;<br />
- Investing in upgrades and the expansion of the electricity grid; and after 2018 by commissioning new generation facilities and reducing specific fuel costs;<br />
- Increasing annual gas production to 40-45bn cubic meters per year and covering 90% of gas demand with domestic gas;<br />
- Fully covering coal demand by increasing cost effective thermal coal production to 75m tons per year and coking coal production to 40m tons per year;<br />
- Significantly reducing public spending by terminating subsidies and increasing the efficiency of electricity sector companies;<br />
- Implementing comprehensive energy efficiency programmes to reduce specific energy consumption by 30-35 per cent by 2030;<br />
- attracting necessary investments (about USD 200bn) into the energy sector; this will require developing an industry reform program, creating competitive markets, increasing electricity prices in order to create a favourable investment climate for private investors, strengthening control over monopolies, and improving and stabilizing the regulatory framework. Investment needs in order to get to the 2030 forecast run upwards of EUR 46bn in the thermal power sector alone (where capacity remains on the current level).",UKR,"Energy,Industry",Executive,published,,Decree/order/ordinance; Strategy,"Energy Demand, Energy Supply, Institutions / Administrative arrangements, Research and development",""

1385,1385,National Energy Strategy (Interministerial Decree of 8 March 2013),"The National Energy Strategy (NES), which has a double time horizon (2020 and 2050), directs efforts towards substantially improving the competitiveness of the energy system and environmental sustainability.<br />
The results expected by 2020 are:<br />
â€¢ Wholesale prices of all energy sources will be aligned with average European average price levels, resulting in savings of about EUR9bn (USD11.3bn)/year in the overall power and gas bill (from current EUR70bn (USD87.8bn) - assuming same commodity prices).<br />
â€¢ Expenditure on energy imports will be reduced by about EUR14bn (USD17.6bn)/year from the present EUR62bn (USD77.8bn), and dependency on foreign supplies from 84% to 67%, thanks to energy efficiency, increased production from renewables, lower electricity imports and increased production from national resources.<br />
â€¢ Private investment of EUR180bn (USD213bn) will be supported by incentives between now and 2020 in renewables and energy efficiency and in traditional sectors (electricity and gas networks, re-gasification plants, storage, hydrocarbon development).<br />
â€¢ GHG emissions will fall by about 21% compared to the 2005 level, exceeding the European 20-20-20 targets for Italy.<br />
â€¢ Renewable energy sources will account for 19-20% of gross final consumption (compared with about 10% in 2010). This is equivalent to 22-23% of primary energy consumption, while fossil fuel use will fall from 86% to 76%. Renewables will become the primary source in the electricity sector together with gas, accounting for 34-38% of consumption (compared with 23% in 2010).<br />
â€¢ Primary consumption will fall by about 24% by 2020 compared with the reference scenario (an estimated 4% below 2010 levels); this exceeds the European 20-20-20 targets of -20%, thanks mainly to energy efficiency measures.<br />
To attain these results, the strategy formulates seven priorities, each with specific supporting measures already set in motion or currently being defined:<br />
â€¢ Fostering Energy Efficiency<br />
â€¢ Promoting a competitive gas market, integrated with the other European markets and with aligned prices<br />
â€¢ Developing renewable in a sustainable way, in order to exceed the European targets (\20-20-20\), while at the same time keeping energy bills competitive<br />
â€¢ Developing an efficient electricity market fully integrated with the European market; with gradual integration of renewable power production<br />
â€¢ Restructuring the refining industry and the fuel distribution network, to achieve a more sustainable system competitive on the European level<br />
â€¢ Sustainably raising national hydrocarbons production, which will bring major economic and employment benefits, while observing the highest international standards in terms of security and environmental protection<br />
â€¢ Modernising governance of the energy sector to make decision-making processes more effective and more efficient<br />
â€¢ Research and development will play a key role in developing technologies that allow for a more competitive and sustainable energy system<br />
The NES lays down long-term indicative objectives for 2050. Among the most important:<br />
â€¢ The need to strengthen efforts in energy efficiency. Primary consumption will have to fall in the range of 17-26% by 2050 compared to 2010, by decoupling economic growth from energy consumption. In particular, efforts in building and transport will be critical<br />
â€¢ The high penetration of renewable energy, than in any of the scenarios envisaged at the time is expected to reach levels of at least 60% of gross final consumption by 2050, with much higher levels in the electricity sector. In addition to the need of research and development for the reduction of costs, it will be fundamental to rethinking the market and network infrastructure<br />
â€¢ A substantial increase in the degree of electrification, which will almost double by 2050, reaching at least 38%, particularly in electricity and transport<br />
â€¢ The key role of gas for the energy transition, despite a reduction of its weight both in percentage and in absolute value in the span of the scenario",ITA,"Residential and Commercial,Energy,Industry,Transportation",Executive,published,,Decree/order/ordinance; Strategy,"Energy Demand, Energy Supply, Institutions / Administrative arrangements, Research and development",""

Thus, the value of the carbon component of the tariffs for these taxes is set at 44.60 euros / tonne of CO2 in 2018 (instead of 39 euros initially), 55 euros in 2019 (against 47.5 euros) and 65 , 40 euros in 2020 (against 56 euros), to reach 86.20 euros in 2022. In addition, it is expected in the new tariffs of TICPE (domestic consumption tax on energy products) a convergence of the tariff of diesel towards the gasoline tariffs in four years, ie by 2021.

It remains based on the only carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of vehicles without taking into account their pollutant emissions (fine particles, nitrogen oxides ...) but the trigger threshold of the malus has been lowered from 127 to 120 grams of CO2 / km. The law sets a progressive scale ranging from 50 euros for the least emitting vehicles to 10,500 euros for those emitting 185 g of CO2 / km or more.<br />

It reiterates the country's pledge, first made in 2009, to reduce emissions by 16% below 2020 business-as-usual levels if there is a legally-binding global agreement in which all countries implement their commitments in good faith. Ahead of this, Singapore has embarked on policies and measures that will reduce its emissions by 7% to 11% below 2020 BAU levels.<br />
<br />
The strategy identifies accelerated coastal erosion, higher incidences of intense rain or prolonged drought, biodiversity impacts, and disruption to food and other supplies as potential climate change impacts facing Singapore. It reiterates the country's commitment to a multilateral approach to dealing with climate change, and argues that a global approach will be more conducive towards Singapore's long-term growth and development. It highlights Singapore's position on a global climate agreement as one that supports the UN model of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.<br />
<br />
The strategy outlines three key principles that guide Singapore's response to climate change:<br />
- Long-term and integrated planning;<br />
- Pragmatically and economically sound measures; and<br />
- Developing innovative solutions for Singapore and global markets.<br />
<br />
It also identifies four main approaches that Singapore will follow in addressing climate change:<br />
- Reducing carbon emissions in all sectors;<br />
- Being ready to adapt to the effects of climate change;<br />
- Harnessing green growth opportunities; and<br />
- Forging partnerships (e.g. with international and regional bodies).<br />
<br />
The document contains chapters on the importance of climate change and Singapore's national circumstances and constraints, as well as detailed chapters on both mitigation and adaptation plans and policies.In terms of mitigation, energy efficiency is the country's core strategy (given the country's limited access to renewable energy opportunities). Specific identified strategies to reduce emissions across different sectors include:<br />
- Power generation: switching fuel mix away from fuel oil to natural gas;<br />
- Water: incinerate sludge rather than dispose in landfills;<br />
- Households: extend minimum energy performance standards to lighting and other appliances;<br />
- Buildings: require Green Mark certification for all new buildings;<br />
- Transport: implement carbon emissions-based vehicle scheme to encourage purchase of low carbon emission cars; and<br />
- Industry: develop and support energy efficiency financing pilot schemes.<br />
<br />

<strong>Hi Michal - for consistency, I think we should either add this strategy or delete the </strong><a href=""http://www.lse.ac.uk/GranthamInstitute/law/low-carbon-transport-innovation-strategy/"">Low Carbon Transport Innovation Strategy</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Clean Growth Strategy exposes how the Government intends to foster national income while reducing greenhouse gases emissions, and do so at the least possible cost for taxpayers while maximising the social and economic benefits. The Strategy comes in line with the commitment made under the 2008 Climate Change Act that requires the country to reduce its emissions ""by at least 80% by 2050"". The Strategy acknowledges that efforts to reduce emissions will have to significantly ramp up in order to meet the fourth and fifth carbon budgets (covering the periods 2023-2027 and 2028-2032). Beyond setting up the strategy to 2032, the document explores electrification, hydrogen and emissions removal as three pathways to 2050.<br />
<br />
The Strategy firstly highlights the image of leadership and situation of progress that the country has made in the last two decades. It details the economic opportunities brought by the Paris Agreement for its low-carbon industries, notably thanks to its academic strength, expertise in high-value service and financial industries and stable regulatory framework. According to the document, the low carbon sector could grow by around 11% a year on the period 2015-2030, or four times faster than the overall economy, and ""could deliver between Â£60 billion and Â£170 billion of export sales of goods and services by 2030"". The document also mentions the co-benefits of actions to reduce greenhouse gases emissions on local air quality, public health, the economy and the environment. The Strategy also recalls the objective of energy affordability and the fact that leaving the EU represents an opportunity as ""domestic binding emissions targets are more ambitious than those set by EU legislation"". <strong>I feel this paragraph could be reduced has it is only exposing the document's rhetoric</strong><br />
<br />
A number of more precise objectives are detailed as following: 1) develop green finance capabilities, including by setting up a green finance taskforce and providing up to Â£20 million to support a new clean technology early stage investment fund,- 2) develop a package of measures to support businesses to improve their energy productivity, by at least 20% by 2030,- 3) improving energy efficiency and aiming at reducing emissions from homes by 19% and energy use by 9%,- 4) rolling out low carbon heating,- 5) accelerate the shift to low carbon transport and reduce emissions by 29% by relying mostly on electric vehicles,- 6) deliver clean, smart, flexible power,- 7)enhance the benefits and value of domestic natural resources,- 8) and lead in the public sector. The government also commits Â£2.5 billion of investment in transport (33% of the total), power, cross-sector, smart systems, homes, business and industry, land use and waste.<br />
<br />
<strong>The document does not expressly deals with solar PV, onshore wind, tidal power, the role of nuclear and renewables, CCUS ( regarding CCUS: ""It outlines that the government will work in partnership with industry through a new CCUS Council, to ""put us on a path to meet our ambition of having the option of deploying CCUS at scale in the UK"", but it provides little comfort for the CCUS industry, when the second CCUS competition was scrapped after costing Â£100 million with a Â£1 billion prize."")</strong>",GBR,"Economy-wide,Energy,Health,Industry,LULUCF,Transportation,Waste",Executive,draft,,Strategy,"Adaptation, Energy Demand, Energy Supply, Institutions / Administrative arrangements, Research and development, Transportation",""
1602,1602,Green Growth and Climate Resilience - National Strategy on Climate Change and Low Carbon Development,"The Strategy seeks to meet development goals while reducing the country's vulnerability through mitigation and adaptation. The key mitigation strategies are: promoting geothermal power generation, with an estimated potential of 700 MW, enough to meet all of Rwanda's demand if implemented by 2020; integrated soil fertility management, which would cut use of inorganic fertilisers, improve soil structure and the water retention capacity of soil; and high density walkable cities, fighting anticipated trends of energy-intensive urban sprawl on hilly terrain.<br />
<br />
Key adaptation elements are irrigation infrastructure, which will reduce uncertainty regarding rainfall variation; a robust road network to mitigate loss of food during transportation to markets and to ensure access during extreme weather events; the establishment of a centre for climate knowledge for development; and development of agroforestry.<br />
<br />
The strategy calls for existing programmes to be used to make quick advances - the Integrated Development Programme (IDP) to facilitate implementation of climate-resilient low-carbon development in rural areas; the National Fund for Climate and Environment (FONERWA) to facilitate access to international climate finance, especially Fast Start Finance for adaptation; implementing measuring and reporting of cross-sectoral energy use for planning and international reporting purposes; setting up an online Climate Portal to communicate the National Strategy to the public and the international community.<br />

Furthermore, the Act designated a national inventory agency. The Agency is charged with recording and reporting information relating to GHG emissions in accordance with New Zealand’s international requirements. The Act has been amended numerous times, most recently by the Climate Change Response (Zero Carbon) Amendment Bill in November 2019:

The Zero Carbon amendment sets a target to reduce net carbon emissions to zero by 2050. It also sets targets for biogenic methane emissions (from agriculture and waste) - 10% by 2030 (compared with 2017 levels), and 24%-47% reduction by 2050 (compared with 2017 levels). 5 year rolling carbon budgets are set, and obligations set to monitor meeting of those budgets. By 2024, a review will be carried out with regards to inclusion of emissions from international shipping and aviation in the 2050 target.

The amendment mandates carrying out a periodic national climate risk assessment, and sets obligations on government to follow every assessment with a national adaptation plan.

The amendment establishes a Climate Change Commission which serves an an independent advisory board to government. The Commission's role is to provide independent, expert advice to the Government mitigation and adaptation, and to monitor and review the Government’s progress towards its emissions reduction and adaptation goals.

The Zero Carbon amendment sets consulting obligations with Māori and iwi leadership bodies under the obligations of the Treaty of Waitangi on multiple aspects of the law.

Previous amendments:

The Climate Change Response (Unit Restriction) Amendment Act 2014 ensures that only domestic emission units within the NZ ETS can be surrendered by participants when deregistering post-1989 forest land from the NZ ETS.

The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2012 maintains the costs that the NZ ETS places on the economy at current levels. Essentially, the 2012 amendments prolong the transitional measures introduced in 2009: non-forestry obligations remain at one emission unit for two tonnes of actual emissions, there is no phase-out of free allocations, and the unit price is capped at NZD 25 (USD 19.65). The most significant change however is that agriculture will not have to surrender obligations from 2015.

They will be phased out at 1.3 percent rate starting from 2016. The Act also stated that additional allocations of emission certificates will be given to emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries.

The Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Forestry Sector) Amendment Act 2009 made technical amendments to the forestry sector’s participation in the NZ ETS, specifically, giving the Minister in charge the ability to withdraw or suspend draft allocation plans, and changing the timeframes for the surrender of units in relation to pre-1990 forest land activities.

2033,2033,13th Five-Year Plan,"The 13th Five Year Plan lays down the strategy and pathway for China's development for 2016-2020 and includes concrete environmental and efficiency targets. It gives top priority to economic development to reach a GDP growth rate of 6.5-7% per annum, consistent with the goal of becoming a 'moderately prosperous society' by 2020, guided by five key principles of 'innovative, coordinated, green, open, and shared development'. At the same time, the 13th Five Year Plan sets peak targets for carbon emissions and energy and water consumption, as well as goals for increasing efficiency of industries and eliminating outdated or overcapacity production facilities, increasing energy production from renewables, and developing green infrastructure. It follows the 11th Five Year Plan, which implemented the concept of energy intensity targets in a number of pilot projects, and the 12th Five Year Plan, which broadened the nature of economic growth towards social inclusiveness and sustainability.<br />
<br />
<strong>Carbon Emissions</strong><br />
<br />
China aims to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 18% from 2015 levels by 2020, in line with China's pledge at the COP21 conference in Paris in December 2015, where President Xi Jinping affirmed China's commitment to reduce total carbon emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65% from 2005 levels by 2030 and peak carbon emissions by 2030.<br />
<br />
The 13th Five-Year Plan also tasks the government with developing rules and regulations to manage the national carbon trading program to be developed based on expansion of the existing seven pilot schemes and expected to be launched around 2018.<br />
<br />
<strong>Energy </strong><br />
<br />
China aims to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by 15% from 2015 levels by 2020 (compared to the 16% set in 12th Five-Year Plan 2011-2015, which eventually delivered a reduction of about 18.2%). This more conservative goal is consistent with the estimated 6.5%-7% GDP growth rate projected for 2016-2021, which is slower than the 7% growth rate targeted in the 12th Five-Year Plan. To reach this target, the 13th Five Year Plan specifies sectoral targets and milestones. First, it sets a further goal to reduce energy consumption per unit of GDP by at least an additional 3.4% in 2016. Second, it caps China's total energy consumption at 5 billion metric tons of standard coal equivalent by 2020, a 16.3% increase in consumption from 2015 levels.<br />
<br />
To reach these goals, China's energy production mix is set to diversify and shift away from coal and towards greater proportion of renewables. China is increasing the efficiency of coal burning power plants and also plans to shut down coal-fired boilers that fail to meet national standards, and has restricted construction of new coal-fired power plants. The Plan also supports increase in renewable energy capacity and connection through national government support for wind, solar, and biomass energy production. The Government will also continue to invest in new hydropower, energy storage and nuclear power projects, as well as further increase in the network of smart grids and ultra high-voltage power transmission.<br />
<br />
<strong>Transportation</strong><br />
<br />
The transportation measures and goals in the 13th Five Year Plan are closely related to addressing air pollution, in order to ""maintain acceptable air quality levels in major cities for 80% of days by the end of 2020"". The Plan aims to expand the electric vehicle market, by constructing dedicated parking lots and charging facilities, and removing almost 4 million high-emission vehicles from roads. The Plan will continue to support adoption of low-emission ""new energy vehicles"" through subsidies to automakers, local governments for purchase of green fleets, and tax breaks and free registration for consumers.<br />
<br />
<strong>REDD+ and LULUCF</strong><br />
<br />
The 13th Five Year Plan also aims to modernize commercial agriculture production to reduce overcapacity, while aiming to turn 1 million hectares of marginal cropland into forest or grassland. In an effort to reduce air pollution, the Plan also aims to increase forest coverage to 23.04% over the next five years.",CHN,"Agriculture,Residential and Commercial,Energy,LULUCF,Transportation,Water,Rural",Executive,published,Mitigation,Plan,"Energy Demand, Energy Supply, REDD+ and LULUCF, Transportation",""

The aim is to reduce national electricity sector emissions by an estimated 32 % below 2005 levels by 2030 (nearly 870 million tons), in particular in two subcategories of fossil fuel-fired electric generating units: fossil fuel-fired electric steam generating units (mostly coal- and oil-fired power plants), and natural gas-fired combined cycle generating units.<br />
<br />
Options for cutting emissions include investing in renewable energy, energy efficiency, natural gas, and nuclear power, and shifting away from coal-fired power. The Plan also aims to limit shift to natural gas and promote renewables.<br />

The Law transforms the National Institute of Ecology into the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change (INECC). The INECC will be responsible for compiling the National Emissions Inventory, will collaborate in the development of strategies, plans, programmes, instruments and actions related to sustainable development, the environment and climate change, and will help in the evaluation of national climate change policy. Through the Law, the Inter-ministerial Commission on Climate Change (IMCC), initially created by presidential agreement in 2005, is now formally the institution in charge of co-ordinating climate change government actions and formulating and implementing national adaptation and mitigation policies. The GLCC also establishes the National Climate Change System, formed by the IMCC, the INECC, state and municipal governments and representatives of Congress. Its main responsibility will be to co-ordinate the efforts of the Federal Government, states and municipalities.

Taking into account Mexico's vulnerability to climate impacts, the Law puts a strong emphasis on adaptation measures. The objective is to reduce social and ecosystem vulnerability by strengthening the resilience of natural and human systems to reduce damage and risk. One of the tools to achieve this is the 'Risk Atlas' which includes information about current and future vulnerability scenarios.

The GLCC states that the national mitigation policy should include diagnosis, planning, measurement, reporting, verification and assessment of national GHG emissions. The national mitigation strategy will be implemented gradually; initially promoting the strengthening of national capacities and subsequently beginning mitigation activities in the most cost-effective sectors - energy production, transport, agriculture, forests and other land use, waste and industrial processes.

The GLCC also creates a climate change fund, which will channel public, private, national and international funding projects that simultaneously contribute to adaptation and mitigation actions, such as supporting state-level actions, research and innovation projects, technological development and transfer, and the purchase of Certified Emissions Reductions (CERs). The Law establishes a voluntary market for emissions trading to promote GHG reductions in a cost-effective, verifiable, measurable and reportable manner.

The Plan gives directions to reducing electricity consumption via setting up an advisory team to the Finance Minister and the Accountant General to consult on the objective of granting NIS 500 million over ten years for investment loans in energy efficiency and greenhouse gases emissions reductions. The grants program in energy efficiency will be operated by the Investment Centre and the National Authority for Technology and Innovation. The decision stipulates that grants will be awarded on a competitive basis over the economic performance of emissions reduction per unit of electricity saved. The Ministry of Finance alone shall allocate a budget of NIS 300 million.<br />
<br />
The decision tasks the Ministry of Energy to: 1) provide a multi-year plan for energy efficiency for 2030, 2) evaluate how to reduce electricity consumption, 3) amend the law accordingly to institute a mechanism for generating units of energy saved (Negawatts) in energy supply and demand, and to use electricity bills as a clearinghouse for repayment of loans, taking into consideration financial exposure of electricity providers.

The Plan sets out how the UK will achieve decarbonisation within the framework of energy policy - making a transition to a low carbon economy while maintaining energy security and minimising costs to consumers (particularly those in poorer households).<br />
<br />
The Plan sets out proposals and policies to meet the UK's first four carbon budgets, each lasting five years with increasing emissions reductions targets. The fourth budget, for the period 2023-2027, requires emissions to be reduced by 50% compared to 1990 levels.<br />
<br />
The plan includes 5 sectoral plans, covering measures to be taken during this decade and in the 2020s:<br />
- Low carbon buildings, including energy efficiency and low carbon heating<br />
- Low carbon transport<br />
- Low carbon industry<br />
- Low carbon electricity<br />
- Agriculture, land use, forestry and waste<br />
<br />
The government will support up to 1.5 million solid wall insulations and other energy efficiency measures, introduce zero-carbon home standards to support energy efficiency improvements. It will also support over 130,000 low carbon heat installations by 2020 and work with local authorities to support district heating networks. The Plan sets out that emissions from buildings should be 24%-39% lower than 2009 levels by 2027.<br />
<br />
The government will support the market roll-out of ultra-low emission vehicles and the take-up of other lower carbon travel methods (walking, cycling, public transport), with the aim that transport emissions should be 17%-28% lower than 2009 levels by 2027.<br />
Emissions from industry will be reduced by 20%-24% compared to 2009 levels by 2027, through a mix of energy efficiency measures, low carbon fuel use, EU ETS membership, and CCS development.<br />
<br />
By 2027, emissions from electricity should be 75%-84% lower than 2009 levels. These reductions will come from increasing use of gas and renewables instead of coal, the introduction of Contacts for Difference in feed-in tariffs, and support for renewables development, CCS development, and reductions in the cost of offshore wind. The Plan does not set any specific technology or decarbonisation targets, and supports the lowest cost mix of nuclear, renewables and CCS use by 2027.<br />

It sets the principles on the use of market mechanisms to encourage a secure and more environmentally friendly supply of energy. It provides that the State has a responsibility to create overarching energy plans ('Strategic Energy Plan', or 'Basic Energy Plan') and commit to reducing environmental impacts. The role of subnational governments is to implement the national measures in own jurisdiction.<br />
A Strategic Energy Plan sets out basic energy measures, long-term and comprehensive measures and research and development needed to achieve the above. The Plan is sent to discussion and adoption by the Diet, and to date four plans have been adopted (October 2003, March 2007, June 2010, April 2014).<br />
The Fourth Strategic Energy Plan (April 2014) added safety into the basic policy perspective, on top of the 3 elements ('the 3Es') mentioned in the previous plans: energy security, economic efficiency and environment (collectively known as '3E+S'). Diversification of energy sources and flexible and efficient energy demand structure are the two basic pillars of energy policy, reflecting the learning from the 2011 energy crisis. Promotion of resilient energy supply structure and improvement of self-sufficiency of energy supply are emphasised as national interest for energy policy.<br />
In particular, the Fourth Strategic Energy Plan sets the following targets:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li> Efficient lighting equipment (e.g. LED lighting and organic EL lighting): target ""penetration rate of 100% on a flow basis by 2020 and on a stock basis by 2030"" (page 39)</li><br />
<li>Low-emission vehicles: target increase in the ""ratio of next-generation vehicles to all new vehicles to 50%-70% by 2030 while promoting comprehensive measures, including steps to improve traffic flow such as the development of loop routes and other trunk road networks and introduction of the Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which will contribute to energy efficiency' (page 40)</li><br />
<li>Storage batteries: promote introduction by ""lowering their cost and improving their performance through technological development and international standardization so that Japanese companies related to the storage battery business will capture a share of 50% in the global storage battery market (20 trillion yen) by 2020' (page 76)</li><br />

The law supports a broad variety of power generation options, including oil, coal and natural gas, hydroelectric power, wind, solar, geothermal and other renewable sources of power, as well as energy efficiency and distribution and transmission systems upgrades. The Electricity Africa Act however particularly promotes renewable energy projects, as the law requires the U.S. government to promote the spread of distributed renewable energy in sub-Saharan Africa, including off-grid lighting and power. The priority given to off-grid generation is an endorsement of existing efforts, already carried out by a sub-initiative of Power Africa Initiative (see below).<br />
To create lasting infrastructures, the law seeks to promote policies to facilitate private financing and public-private partnerships, allow independent producers' participation in electricity markets, and encourage other regulatory reforms in the power sector. The law calls on the US to partner with sub-Saharan African countries, international and regional financial institutions and the private sector to meet the above goals and implement a strong monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.<br />
The Electricity Africa Act does not allocate new funds to the US agencies, but builds on and backs the <a href=""https://www.dlapiper.com/en/china/insights/publications/2013/07/us-commits-$7b-to-ambitious-power-africa-initiat__/"">Power Africa Initiative</a>, launched in 2013 with a goal of doubling access to electricity across sub-Saharan Africa. The Initiative commits the US to US$7 billion support to the energy sector in sub-Saharan Africa.<br />
The law requires the President of the U.S. to submit to the US Senate, within 6 months of the law's enactment, a report outlining a multiyear strategy for reaching the objectives of the law.<br />
The Electricity Africa Act also directs U.S. government agencies, such as US Agency for International Development (USAID), the US Trade and Development Agency, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, to prioritize loans, grants and technical support for power generation and transmission projects in sub-Saharan Africa.

2012,2012,Royal Decree 900/2015 on Energy Self-Consumption,"The Royal Decree seeks to promote economically sustainable distributed generation and the use of renewable energies, but also introduces charges and tolls for grid access, with the goal of fair burden-sharing among electricity grid users.<br />
All self-consumers connected to the grid (see below) have to be registered with the Registry for Electrical Energy Self-Consumption, even if they do not ever intend on selling any surplus energy that they generate to the grid (isolated facilities exempt).<br />
There are two self-consumption modalities:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>'supply with self-consumption' - consumer with a contracted power of maximum 100 kW, owning at least one generation facility within its internal network, not registered as production facility</li><br />
<li>'production with self-consumption' - consumer associated to at least one generation facility connected within its network; the total power of the production facilities must be lower or equal to the consumer contracted power</li><br />
</ul><br />
The Decree allows for electricity storage devices installed within the self-consumption facilities, but makes them financially unattractive.<br />
All self-consumers have to pay 'access tolls' to the grid to contribute to its maintenance and operations. Tolls depend on the real use of the grid (contracted power and energy introduced in the border point). Under the second modality, 'access tolls' for feeding energy to the network are to be paid. In addition, all self-consumers have to pay the ""charges associated to the electricity system cost"", as well as the 'charge for other services of the system' (i.e. back-up of the self-consumer's facilities provided by the electrical system; can vary or be exempt for non-mainland territories and low voltage consumers - under 10 kW). Some existing facilities (e.g. cogeneration, small generation of <50 MW) are temporarily exempt from the charges until 31 December 2019.<br />
Both types of self-consumers can purchase additional electricity. However, only facilities registered under the second modality are entitled to receive a financial compensation for providing electricity to the grid. This prohibits individual small self-consumers from receiving compensation for any self-generated and unused electricity, unless they register as electricity production businesses.",ESP,"Energy,Transportation",Executive,published,,Decree/order/ordinance,"Energy Demand, Energy Supply, Institutions / Administrative arrangements",""
2010,2010,"Act on Renewable Energy Sources ('RES Act', Dz.U. 2015 poz. 478)","This Act defines the new regime for support to renewable energy sources (including wind energy, energy radiation of the sun, solar, aerothermal, geothermal, hydrothermal energy, hydropower, waves, currents error and tidal energy obtained from biomass, biogas, agricultural biogas and bioliquid - art. 2.22), aiming to stabilise the long-term support system, with the goal to prevent electricity prices form increasing in an uncontrolled manner. The Act also transposes the Directive 2009/28/EC on renewable energy into Polish legislation and aims to contribute to Poland's target of reaching 15% share of renewable energy production by 2020.
The Act will provide continuing support to most existing installations (in operation by or before 31 December 2015) through certificates of origin, while future investments will compete for support through an auction system organised by the President of the Energy Regulatory Office (ERO).
The auctions, applying to new installations over 10 kW of installed capacity, will be based on a type of contract-for-difference (CfD) granted, with separate auctions for old and new plants and for plants of 1 MW or less, as well as varied reference prices for the eighteen renewable sources reference groups. The chosen renewable plants will have to start generation within 24 months (solar plants), 72 months (wind plants) or 48 months (others), and they will be required to deliver at least 85% of the volume offered in the bid, under threat of penalty. The energy auctioned will be bought by the newly formed state-owned entity Operator Rozlicze? Energii Odnawialnej (for energy produced in installations above 500kW) or by electricity distribution companies (for energy produced in installations up to 500kW). Most existing installations will also be eligible to change to the auction support instrument from the current certificates of origin, except for hydropower plants over 5 MW, non-qualified biomass co-firing installations (art. 44) and biomass installations exceeding 50 MW of electrical power (or 150 MW of CHP power).
The existing installations will continue to be eligible for the existing system of support through certificates of origin (introduced through the 1997 Energy Law), but a number of limits will apply:
<ul>
<li style=""list-style-type: none;"">
<ul>

<ul>
<li>large consumers (over 100 GWh of electricity consumed annually) and commodity brokerage houses are required to obtain certificates of origin for 14% and 15% of their annual electricity consumption for 2015 and 2016 respectively or pay the substitution fee. From 2017 the share is min 20%, but can be reduced by the Minister of Economy, if necessary due to specific market conditions. A unit substitution fee is set to a constant 300.03 PLN/MWh (2014 level, approx. 72 â‚¬/MWh), which should stabilise the price of certificates, as purchasing and redeeming of certificates of origin will only be allowed if the average market price of certificates remains below 75% of the substitution fee.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
The Act also introduces a feed-in tariff system for micro installations of up to 10 kW (max 40 kW under special conditions - art. 41.7), while guaranteeing purchase by electricity distribution companies at 100% of market price for the next 15 years, until no later than December 31, 2035 (art. 41.5). The support also covers the so-called â€˜prosumers,' who both produce and consume their own electricity. The subsidies amount to PLN 0.75 (EUR 0.18) per kWh to prosumers with a capacity of up to 3 kW (hydropower, wind, solar), and PLN 0.40-0.70 (EUR 0.10-0.17) for those with a capacity between 3 and 10 kW (biogas, hydropower, wind, solar). Moreover, there are no licensing/concession requirements for those micro generators that do not have active business.

The Act was amended in June 2018, alongside the 2016 Act on investments in wind power and the 1994 Construction Act, in order to boost offshore wind investment.

1817,1817,Document CONPES 3700 on the Institutional Strategy for the Articulation of Policies and Actions in Climate Change,"The main objective of CONPES 3700 is to outline a mechanism for institutional co-ordination to incorporate climate change into sectorial and territorial decision making, the National Climate Change System (SISCLIMA).<br />
<br />
CONPES 3700 recommended the creation of SISCLIMA as the official national institution to coordinate and propel climate change actions. Within these actions, SISCLIMA will co-ordinate the implementation of the four climate change priority strategies defined by the government: CCNAP, CLCDS, ENREDD+ and the Strategy for Fiscal Protection Against Natural Disasters. It is expected that these strategies will need to formulate their own financing strategy and to add a component for private sector investment.<br />
<br />
The proposed approach is one whereby climate change initiatives will be built through a bottom-up approach. Four permanent committees at the base of the SISCLIMA structure will coordinate, shape and implement sectoral and territorial policy as well as international affairs for climate change adaptation and mitigation based on detailed technical studies carried out on specialised working groups. The Finance Committee (FC) will act as coordinator of financing activities and offer support to those initiatives seeking financial support by directing efforts to identify and coordinate sources of finance available at the national and international levels. Finally, at the very top of the system, the Inter-Sectoral Commission on Climate Change (COMICC) will bring together various ministries and key national institutions to co-ordinate and direct institutional efforts on climate change and act as the connection point between SISCLIMA and the wider government, including the presidency. COMICC will also share findings and guide policy at the highest level of the national government on climate change issues. The final structure however is still under revision.<br />
<br />
A Presidential Decree is required to give effect to CONPES 3700. At the time of writing (November 2014) this has not been issued and meanwhile successive drafts of the REDD+ Readiness Preparation Proposal (R-PP) have introduced further refinements. For example, CONPES 3700 envisages that SISCLIMA will be directed by an Executive Committee (COMECC). The latest drafts of the R-PP have sought to make SISCLIMA's governance more inclusive; COMECC has now become an Inter-Sectoral Committee (COMICC).",COL,"Residential and Commercial,Transportation",Executive,published,,Strategy,Institutions / Administrative arrangements,""

Over exploitation of natural resources and environmental costs have been warned as it results in climate change threats; Cameroon is partly located in Sahel area with existing harmful effects of climate change: desert encroachment, increased temperatures, irregular seasons, sea level rise, floods, volcanism, landslides rock fall and toxic fumes. The document calls for reduction of greenhouse gases to tackle climate change as a key regional strategy for Cameroon. The Government of Cameroon pledges to seek high growth level while achieving Millennium Development Goals.<br />
<br />
Under the tentative implementation schedule of Vision 2035, drafting and implementation of major environmental policy to fight against the climate change impact is planned for the phase one (2010-2019). Climate change control is listed as one of the three specific objectives for the phase two (2020-2027). Specific actions include protecting and ensuring sustainable management of forest ecosystems, fighting desert encroachment and promoting regional projects like the Niger Basin and the Lake Chad Basin.Diversification of energy source and replacement of fossil fuel with clean energy supplies is mentioned in the document without quantitative targets.",CMR,"Economy-wide,Energy,Industry,LULUCF,Water",Executive,published,,Strategy,"Adaptation, Energy Supply, REDD+ and LULUCF",""

<br />
Congress passed the first Clean Air Act in 1963, creating a research and regulatory programme in the US Public Health Service. The Act authorised development of emission standards for stationary sources. In the Clean Air Act Extension of 1970, Congress greatly expanded the federal mandate by requiring comprehensive federal and state regulations for both industrial and mobile sources. The law established four new regulatory programmes:<br />
- National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) - EPA was required to promulgate national standards for six criteria pollutants: carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, particulate matter, hydrocarbons and photochemical oxidants (some of the criteria pollutants were revised in subsequent legislation)<br />
- State Implementation Plans (SIPs)<br />
- New Source Performance Standards (NSPS)<br />
- National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPs)<br />
<br />
The EPA was also created under the National Environmental Policy Act about the same time as these additions were passed, which was important to help implement the programmes listed above.<br />
<br />
Since then, the Clean Air Act has been amended (in 1977 and 1990) to strengthen its effect, including adding regulations relating to acid deposition (to tackle acid rain) and stratospheric ozone protection.<br />
<br />
The EPA's 2009 finding that GHG emissions endanger health and welfare opened the door to EPA regulation of substances for their GHG effect.<br />
<br />
The EPA began regulating GHGs from mobile and stationary sources of air pollution under the Clean Air Act for the first time in 2011.

Electricity produced from qualifying renewable sources and energy used and generated in approved combined heat and power schemes are no longer exempt from the levy.

There is also a reduced (20%) rate for energy-intensive businesses that enter into voluntary agreements to reduce their energy use and/or emissions.

The Plan includes a summary of current emissions and projections of climate impacts. The mitigation measures draw upon the 2008 National Energy Strategy and are mainly related to energy efficiency and the production of renewable energy. They comprise seven areas: energy demand and supply, transportation, industry, waste management, agriculture, forestry and construction. In order to promote mitigation measures, the Department for the Environment should: promote CDM projects; elaborate GHG inventories, particularly aiming at establishing carbon pricing; and establish green taxes for electric equipment and energy efficiency improvement in existing buildings.<br />
<br />
Adaptation measures are proposed within the areas of weather forecast, water resources, agriculture, forestry, desertification, fisheries, public health, and tourism.<br />
<br />
The National Plan against Climate Change establishes a number of research initiatives to promote climate change mitigation and adaptation.

It also specifies the authorities responsible for the management of fuels and energy. Among others, it established the basis for independent electricity and gas production and access of independent power producers to the grid, principles for least cost and integrated resource planning, support to high efficiency heat and power production, demand side management and energy efficiency labels.<br />
It facilities the production of electricity from renewable energy sources (up to 5MW), making them eligible to benefit from a reduced grid connection fee and exempt from paying annual licence fees. Energy providers are allowed to incorporate costs of developing renewable energy into their tariff regimes. Since 1 October 2005, energy enterprises that generate, trade or purchase electricity are obliged to purchase or generate a certain amount of electricity from renewable sources of energy. The obligation will be met through the acquisition and redemption of certificates of origin that certify electricity produced from renewable sources. Transmissions and distribution operators are obliged to accept renewable sources of energy. Similar scheme for heat produced from renewable energy sources entered into force on 1 January 2007.<br />
The amendment of 26 July of 2013 simplified the setting up a micro-installation (renewable energy sources with no more than 40kW of total installed electrical capacity, connected to electrical grid of a voltage lower than 110kV or no more than 120 kW of total installed heat capacity). Applications to connect a micro-installation to the grid will no longer be subject to a connection fee nor required to attach documents confirming the admissibility of locating the installation in the investment area. In some cases, there will be no need for an interconnection agreement. It also expands the definition of renewable energy sources to aerothermal and hydrothermal, it provides the protection of vulnerable consumers, as well as support for energy-intensive industries.<br />
In order to make the gas market more transparent and competitive, the Small Tri-Pack imposes the obligation to sell at least 30% (40% since 2014 and 55% since 2015) of the gas at the exchange markets. The Act also exempts people producing energy from renewable resources for their own purposes from the obligation to obtain the license for the power supply.<br />

It also establishes that the wholesale electricity market must buy the green tariff electricity from alternative energy sources, and sell it directly to consumers or energy supplying companies.<br />
<br />
Green tariff is defined as a special tariff for electricity generated at the power plants that use alternative sources of energy (except blast-furnace and coke gases; with regard to hydropower - at small plants only, i.e. with capacity up to 10 MWel).<br />
<br />
The amended Law obliges the Ukrainian wholesale electricity providers to purchase electricity generated at the power plants that use alternative sources of energy through the green tariff. The green tariff was planned as a double average tariff for traditional electricity sold on the Ukrainian wholesale market in the year preceding the year of the tariff decision.<br />

The main aim of the Act is to contribute to an adequate energy supply - i.e. diversified, safe, economical and compatible with the requirements of environmental protection. Its principal goals include:<br />
- ensure production and distribution of economic power, compatible with the requirements of environmental protection<br />
- promote the efficient and rational use of energy<br />
- encourage the use of indigenous and renewable energy.<br />
The Act provides three main targets, to be reached in co-operation with the Cantons, the energy sector and other stakeholders:<br />
- The average annual electricity production from renewable sources is to be increased by at least 5,400 GWh by 2030 compared to 2000. Up to 10% of the required target can be met by renewable electricity generation abroad (e.g.CDM).<br />
- The average annual hydro-power production is to increase by at least 2,000 GWh by 2030 compared to 2000<br />
- Households' final energy consumption must be stabilised by 2030 at the level it would have had at the entry into force of this provision (2009).<br />
Among the measures put forward by the Act to meet the above targets are certification of electricity origin (renewable electricity certificates), preferential installation of new renewable electricity or CHP compared to fossil fuel plants, mandatory offtake for renewable electricity for utilities (conditions apply) with financial support for solar PV plants (30kW max), and energy labelling for buildings, vehicles and appliances.<br />

It includes provisions for a feed-in tariff for electricity from solar PV, wind, hydro (up to 10MW), geothermal and biomass. The payments are made for 10, 20 or 25 years and are differentiated according to application, technology and size of the installation. They only apply to installations built, renovated or expanded after 1 January 2006. The overall funding for available feed-in tariffs is capped in 2015 at approximately CHF580m (USD605.9m), with funds to be distributed among the different types of technologies so as to ensure their parallel development (the entire fund cannot assigned to one single technology).<br />

1668,1668,Law 24/2013 on the Electric sector,"This Law repealed Law 54/1997, which previously regulated the sector. The main driver for the law was to reduce the unsustainable tariff deficit of the electricity sector.

A new support scheme for renewable energy sources is planned, based on the direct participation of renewable energy sources in the market, forcing them to compete with traditional sources, although the scheme will allow renewable energies to recover costs that could not be recovered by selling energy on the market. The evaluation of such costs will be based on a theoretical renewable plant and on the average costs incurred by a well-managed company running said installation. Only administrative costs that are uniform at national level will be considered, so administrative costs at regional level are not considered in the framework of the law. The law allows for additional support schemes, but only if they are necessary to achieve European goals. With respect to grid access and grid use, renewables are granted priority connection and priority dispatch - provided that these do not constitute a danger to the grid itself.

Law 24/2013 regulates the economic framework for self-production-and consumption of electricity, a topic that had been in debate for months between different stakeholders. It states that entities that consume the energy they produce will have to make the same contribution to the financing of costs and services of the grid as consumers that take the electricity directly from the grid. This point had been at the centre of the debate and was strongly opposed by renewable energy associations, who thought it would create strong barriers to consumers installing their own renewable generating system. The fine for producers who access the self-consumption scheme incorrectly is set between EUR6m and EUR60m (USD7.53m-USD75.3m).

An Emissions Rights Allocation Committee chaired by the Minister of Strategy and Finance will be established for deliberation and mediation of major issues regarding the emissions rights trading system. The competent authorities will allocate the total emissions rights for the unit period and for each year to relevant corporations. The emissions rights may be traded. Anyone who wants to trade their rights shall enter an account in the emissions rights register.<br />
<br />
The scheme determines that in the event that a corporation produces more GHGs than its allotted amount, the excess will be subject to a penalty of up to three times the average market price of the year, up to a limit of KRW100,000 (USD89.87) per one tonne of CO2.<br />

The Enforcement Decree outlines the rules and governance structure for the ETS, planned to begin on 1 January 2015. The ETS requires each company or organisation to set the goal of emissions reduction and fulfill the required reduction goal by utilising a market mechanism. All six Kyoto Protocol GHGs are included, and the scheme covers direct and indirect emissions from individual facilities producing over 25ktCO2e/yr, companies with multiple installations producing over 125ktCO2e/yr, and any other firm that voluntarily wishes to join the ETS.<br />

This free allocation level will drop to 97% during the second phase (2018 to 2020) and below 90% in the third phase (2021-2025). By easing the cost burden of allowable emissions at an initial stage, it minimises the burden on industry; by expanding the range of paid quota in the mid- to long-term, it lays the foundation for cost-effective GHG reduction.<br />

Offsets are allowed for up to 10% of compliance obligations. International offsets can be used from Phase III, and shall be set within the range of less than 50% of the maximum offsets for the efficient reduction of domestic GHG.

1755,1755,Climate Change Act,"The Act provides a long-term framework to improve carbon management, to help the transition to a low carbon economy, encourage investment in low carbon goods and provide an international signal. The Act establishes a legally binding target for the UK to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. It also creates 5-yearly 'carbon budgets' as a pathway to meet the long-term target.

The Act has now established a legally binding target of at least an 100% cut in GHG emissions by 2050, to be achieved through action in the UK and abroad. Ministers must report on the policies implemented to meet carbon budgets and produce an annual report to Parliament on the status of UK emissions.

The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) - an independent, expert body to advise the government on the level of carbon budgets and on progress in meeting these budgets - submits annual reports to Parliament on progress towards targets and budgets. The government must respond to the reports, ensuring transparency and accountability.

The Act sets up a carbon budgeting system that caps emissions over 5-year periods, with three budgets set at a time, to help the UK stay on track for its 2050 target. The first three carbon budgets run from 2008-2012, 2013-2017 and 2018-2022, and were set in law in May 2009. The fourth carbon budget, for 2023-2027 approved by parliament in 2011 and reviewed in 2014, puts into law a target to reduce emissions by 50% from 1990 levels by 2025 (the midpoint of the budget period).

The government must report to Parliament its policies and proposals to meet the budgets and set a limit on the purchase of carbon credits for each budgetary period - for the first budgetary period, a zero limit was set in May 2009, excluding units bought by UK participants in the EU Emissions Trading System. For the second budget period, a limit of 55MtCO2e was set. The Act also gives powers to introduce domestic emissions trading schemes more quickly and easily through secondary legislation - the first use has been to introduce the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme.

The Act introduced measures on biofuels and powers to introduce pilot financial incentive schemes in England for household waste.

The Act requires, by the end of 2012, the inclusion of international aviation and shipping emissions in the net carbon account, or an explanation to Parliament why not. The government announced in December 2012 that this decision would be deferred, recognising uncertainty over the international framework for reducing aviation emissions and particularly the treatment of aviation within the EU ETS. The new net zero target still excludes aviation and shipping.

The government must report at least every 5 years on the risks to the UK of climate change, and publish a programme setting out how these will be addressed. The first such climate change risk assessment was published in 2012. The Act also introduces powers for government to require public bodies and statutory undertakers to carry out their own risk assessment and make plans to address those risks.

The Act introduces an Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change, providing advice to, and scrutiny of, the Government's adaptation work.

The fifth carbon budget (adopted in June 2016) has set emission reduction levels to 57% compared with 1990 levels. It covers the period between 2028-2032 and is in line with the UK's global commitments.

It also originally mandated electricity producers with capacity of 50MW to produce electricity with minimum of 20% share of renewable resources.<br />
<br />
Due to its generous feed-in tariffs for solar energy, Slovakia witnessed an unanticipated 'solar boom' in early 2011. As a result, in February 2011, the size of the solar installations eligible for these subsidies was scaled back to 100kW, and feed-in tariffs were nearly halved compared to 2009.<br />
<br />
In August 2012, another amendment changed the conditions for producers of electricity from small solar rooftop installations with installed capacities of up to 10 kW. Operators of these installations may now generate electricity for their own use without having to register as an entrepreneur.<br />

According to a 2013 amendment, the feed-in tariff will apply only to rooftop photovoltaic installations on with a maximum capacity of 30kW. All larger installations are no longer be covered by the support mechanism. The initial version of the amendment also envisaged promoting high efficiency cogeneration up to an installed capacity of 300MW, but it was eventually revoked.<br />
<br />
Feed-in tariffs are limited to installations producing electricity from renewable energy sources or CHP with installed power up to 5MW (15MW in the case of wind power).

This will require achieving annual per capita income of USD900 (USD290 today), a poverty rate of 30% (64% today) and an average life expectance of 55 years (49 years today).<br />
<br />
The framework includes the rehabilitation and development of infrastructure as a crucial aspect in lowering the costs of doing business. It calls for: (i) a modern land law providing security of tenure and freedom of exchange; (ii) the development of alternative lower costs of transport to the sea; and (iii) increase of energy production and diversification into alternative energy sources. Rwanda has considerable hydroelectric potential, in addition to large deposits of renewable methane gas in Lake Kivu, estimated at 60bn m3. In rural areas direct solar energy or photovoltaic energy can be used, whilst up to 1/3 of 155m tons of peat deposit is currently exploitable. Rwanda projects that by 2020, at least 35% of the population will be connected to electricity (up from the current 6%).<br />
<br />
Vision 2020 recognises sustainable environmental and climate change management as a cross-cutting pivotal area to the realisation of national aspirations. It recognises that the major problem in environmental protection is the imbalance between the population and the natural resources. This leads to alarming degradation observed through massive deforestation, the depletion of biodiversity, erosion and landslides, pollution of waterways and the degradation of fragile ecosystems.<br />
<br />
To protect the environment against massive deforestation and soil destruction, Vision 2020 sets the target for the protection rate against erosion to rise from 20% in 2000 to 90% by year 2020.

Its main targets relate to: strategic infrastructure investment for exports; more private sector financing to increase exports; urbanisation; and a green economy approach to sustainability. Five priority areas will spearhead this thematic strategy.<br />
<br />
Priority 1 is to increase the domestic interconnectivity of the economy by investing in infrastructure to meet private sector energy demand; increasing access to public goods and resources in priority sectors; and deepening the integration of key value chains.<br />
<br />
Priority 5 is the pursuit of a â€˜green economy' approach to economic transformation, favouring the development of sustainable cities and villages. Key innovations include: piloting a green city; piloting a model mine; and attracting investors in green construction. There will be a focus on green urbanisation and promoting green innovation in industry and the private sector. A Green Urbanisation Centre of Excellence and an Environment and Climate Change Innovation Centre will be created. The Environment and Climate Change Centre will promote transformational green innovation in the industrial and private sectors through (i) support to research and development through links to industry and academia in Rwanda and internationally; (ii) promoting technology transfer in priority sectors through business advice and training; (iii) linking innovation with finance through identifying international funding sources (e.g. FONERWA); (iv) providing analyses and information on market and sector trends.<br />

It repeals the PNAEE 2015, approved by the Resolution of Council of Ministers 80/2008, of 16 May 2008. It is underpinned by the idea that reducing oil dependency reduces the foreign trade deficit, as well as CO2 emissions.

Within the framework of European '20-20-20' targets, Portugal established a general target to be achieved by 2020, to reduce primary energy consumption by 25% along with a specific target for Public Administration of achieving a reduction of 30%. As part of the plan to use energy from indigenous renewable sources, Portugal aims to have 31% of final gross energy consumption and 10% of energy for transport derived from renewable sources, at the least possible cost the economy. It also aims to reduce the nation's energy dependence and ensure security of supplies, by promoting a balanced energy mix.

The PNAEE and PNAER establish ways of achieving these targets and international commitments with regard to energy efficiency and the use of energy from renewable sources. In addition to intensifying the goals, the plans also identify existing barriers and the potential for improvement with a view to establishing the most suitable programmes and measures for complying with its commitments.

The revision of the PNAEE is based on three lines of intervention: (i) action (suitability of the measures); (ii) monitoring (review of the methods for monitoring results), and (iii) governance (redefining the PNAEE governance model). To this end, an estimated impact analysis was carried out for all the measures in the PNAEE, in accordance with European norms on monitoring energy efficiency plans and measures.

The Resolution aims to operationalise the Energy Efficiency Fund and integrate it with other programmes to support energy efficiency, so as to optimise incentives. The Resolution takes into consideration measures already established by the National Climate Change Programme (PNAC).

The implementation of PNAEE 2016 and PNAER 2020 should benefit from a common structure tracking and monitoring of the progress and results of the measures and actions taken in each Plan. The PNAEE 2016 and PNAER 2020 should also be articulated with the structure of supervision and monitoring of the PNAC in 2020, allowing the provision of information for assessing national commitments energy and climate.

It covers a large scope of economic activities and brings in binding energy targets for transport, housing sector and renewable energy. In its 215 articles, the law sets the following ambitious national targets:<br />
<br />
<ul><br />
<li>cut GHG emissions by 40% between 1990 and 2030 and by 75% by 2050;</li><br />
<li>cut the national energy usage by at least 50% by 2050;</li><br />
<li>reduce the share of fossil fuels in energy production by 30% compared to 2012;</li><br />
<li>cap the total output from nuclear power at 63.2 GW and reduce France's reliance on nuclear power from the current 75% to 50% by 2030;</li><br />
<li>bring the share of renewables up to 32% of the energy mix by 2030.</li><br />
</ul><br />
The law also increases the carbon tax on fossil fuel more than four times, from the 2015 rate of â‚¬14.5 to â‚¬56 per ton in 2020, and â‚¬100 in 2030, pending on ratification in the annual budget.<br />
Renewable energy production is supported through simplified administrative procedures for onshore wind farms (art 143) and general permitting process for renewables (art 145). In addition, powers have been given to municipalities to develop district heating and cooling systems (art 194).<br />
The adoption of the law is expected to create more than 75,000 new jobs in the housing sector through retro-fitting the ageing housing stock (which currently consumes about 50% of France's energy).<br />
The law sets minimum energy consumption requirements for public buildings and, where possible, requires them to be energy positive. Minimum energy requirements applicable to social housing are extended from collective dwellings to individual housing (art 13). Energy upgrades or integration of renewable energy sources can also be mandated through local plans (art 8-I). Government support for energy upgrades is maintained (art 14-II and art 22) and the installation of smart meters is mandated by law (conditions apply - art 27) Administrative procedure for energy upgrades of communal parts of buildings is simplified, by recognizing simple majority voting among tenants (art 14-I). Similarly, procedures for building certification are simplified by allowing for certification at delivery of the new built (art 15). Individual billing for heating and electricity consumption are required in all buildings fitted with a collective heating and/or hot water system (art 26).<br />
The law also contains a package of measures to tackle air pollution through a clean transport programme, which incentivises citizens to buy low-emission vehicles by installing approximately 7 million charging stations and dedicated parking places. The law also requires the State to prioritise electric and low-carbon vehicles in procurement (at least 50% of new procurement). Taxi and rental companies will also have to reach a minimum of 10% of low-carbon vehicles in their vehicle park. A subsidy for replacing old diesel vehicles by new ones is also provided, with a dedicated capped budget. In addition, metropolitan areas are allowed to reduce traffic speed on all or part of the city routes (art 47) and introduce temporary traffic bans against polluting vehicles across the city (art 49). Additional measures include: price reductions for access to public transport in case of traffic ban for certain type of vehicles (art 48); penalties for removing particulate filters (art 58); and optimal urban planning of the transport system contributing to reduction of air pollutants (art 66).<br />
The law sets a requirement for investors to declare the environmental impact of their investment portfolios, including specific reference to impact on climate change. Article 173 imposes listed companies to disclose financial risks related to the effects of climate change and measures adopted by the company to reduce them; banks and credit providers shall disclose the risks evidenced by the stress-tests that are regularly implemented in their mandatory risk reports; and institutional investors must disclose information to beneficiaries on how their investment decision-making process takes social, environmental and governance criteria into consideration (including climate risk), and the means implemented to contribute to the financing of the ecological and energy transition. Several other educational and financial assistance projects are to be commissioned to assist citizens with energy efficient retrofits, renewable sources installation and others.<br />

<li>as of 1 January 2017, the use of non-biodegradable and non-compostable plastic packaging for sending addressed or non-addressed press and advertising is prohibited ; </li><br />
<li>state services and local authorities are to decrease their office paper consumption by 30% before 2020;</li><br />
<li>as of 1 January 2017, at least 25% (40% as of 1 January 2020) of paper products, stationery and fiber-based prints acquired by state services and local authorities and their groupings are to be made from recycled paper, with the rest to come from sustainably managed forests;</li><br />
<li>strengthened powers for mayors to deal with abandoned vehicles (art 77);</li><br />
<li>better monitoring of waste (art 82) and fight against chemical waste trafficking (art 77-IV) and unregulated waste disposal (art 78);</li><br />
<li>other quantified limits apply to State and local authorities construction work waste and raw materials use.</li><br />

The mitigation pillar leans on managing energy demand, via energy efficiency and conservation programmes, and on energy supply, via use of low-carbon and renewable energy resources, targeting a doubling of renewable energy capacity by 2030. It encourages low-carbon transportation modes (LPG, bio-fuels) and sustainable, energy-conserving infrastructure building. The infrastructure emphasises the importance of REDD+ policies as a measure to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. Waste management and methane collection are also included in mitigation priorities.<br />
<br />
The Adaptation pillar includes enhanced vulnerability and adaptation assessments, eco-system management (river basin management, coastal and marine systems, biodiversity); water management; climate-responsive agriculture; climate-responsive health sector; climate-proofing infrastructure; and disaster risk reduction.<br />

<br />
The need for the NSDS is stark since the country faces a series of significant challenges: Growth rates are currently largely coupled to resource and natural material use, leading to continued environmental degradation. This has contributed to increasing water scarcity, a significant problem given that storage capacity and water efficiency delivery is low. In the energy sector, thermal efficiency is low, distribution losses are high, and power cuts are reported to be a common frustration for domestic and business users. In addition, strategic energy reserves are low. These problems are set against a backdrop of high poverty and illiteracy rates in addition to increased impacts of natural hazards, notably the impact of disastrous flooding.<br />
The three core programme areas addressed are:<br />
? Economic: Sustainable trade, Cleaner Production, and Sustainable Consumption<br />
? Environment: Natural capital and Biodiversity<br />
? Social: Social protection, poverty alleviation and equal opportunity/human development.<br />
<br />
The strategic goals of the programme are to:<br />
- Promote green investment and green jobs<br />
- Improve eco-efficiency by changing production and consumption systems<br />
- Internalisation of environmental costs into pricing<br />
- Develop sustainable infrastructure focusing on transportation and communication<br />
- Develop demand for sustainable consumption among consumers through awareness raising<br />
- Account for depletion of natural resources in national accounts<br />
- Promote efficient use of energy and water, including through improved watershed management and reforestation<br />
- Improve biodiversity management and increase forest cover; prepare lists of endangered species<br />

1549,1549,Philippine Disaster Reduction and Management Act (RA 10121),"The Act shifted the policy environment and the way the country deals with disasters from mere response to preparedness. RA 10121 provides a comprehensive, all-hazard, multi-sectoral, inter-agency, and community-based approach to disaster risk management through the formulation of the National Disaster Risk Management Framework.<br />
<br />
A National Disaster Risk Management Plan (NDRMP) is being formulated, developed, and implemented as the master plan that will provide the strategies, organisation, tasks of concerned agencies and local government units, and other guidelines in dealing with disasters or emergencies. Through this plan, a coherent, integrated, efficient, and responsive disaster risk management at all levels will hopefully be achieved.<br />
<br />
The law also promotes the development of capacities in disaster management at the individual, organisational, and institutional levels. A very important feature of this law is its call for the mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction in physical and land-use planning, budget, infrastructure, education, health, environment, housing, and other sectors.<br />
<br />
RA 10121 also recognises local risk patterns and trends and decentralisation of resources and responsibilities and thus encourages the participation of NGOs, private sectors, community-based organisations, and community members in disaster management. It inhibits the full participation of the Local Government Units (LGUs) and communities in governance. The approach tends to be 'response-oriented' or 'reactive.' This is evidenced by the widespread emphasis on post-disaster relief and short-term preparedness, such as forecasting and evacuation, rather than on mitigation and post- disaster support for economic recovery.<br />
<br />
Moreover, the Act mandates the establishment of a Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office (DRRMO) in every province, city and municipality, and a Barangay Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Committee (BDRRMC) in every barangay.<br />
<br />
The Strategic National Action Plan on Disaster Risk Reduction for 2009-2019 aims to enhance the capacities of Local Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Councils.<br />

It sets a target to limit 2030 emissions to 150 Mt CO2e (level of 2010 emissions), approximately 250 Mt CO2e less than in the business as usual scenario. It also establishes a target to increase generating capacity by 25,000MW by 2030 - hydro 22,000MW, geothermal 1,000MW and wind 2,000MW. There are programmes to replace wood fuel for domestic use with less polluting fuels, such as biogas. There are plans to distribute 9m stoves by 2015 and 34m by 2030.

The initiative establishes a national financial mechanism called the 'CRGE Facility' to mobilise, access, sequence and blend domestic and international, public and private sources of finance to support the institutional building and implementation of the strategy.

The CRGE initially relies on existing institutions, notably the Environmental Protection Authority (which in 2013 was replaced by the Ministry of Environment and Forest), the Ethiopian Development Research Institute, six ministries, and several government agencies. Subsequent phases will strengthen institutions to implement the strategy.",ETH,"Residential and Commercial,Economy-wide,Energy,Industry,LULUCF,Transportation",Executive,published,"mitigation, adaptation",Strategy,"Adaptation, Energy Demand, Energy Supply, Institutions / Administrative arrangements, REDD+ and LULUCF, Transportation",""

1530,1530,National Forest Policy,"This policy (supported by caveats in the National Environment Policy) addresses the sustainable use of renewable natural resources. It acknowledges the multiple functions of Pakistan's forests, such as carbon storage for climate change mitigation. However, there is a particularly strong focus on forests' role in mountain areas where they provide protection from soil erosion and reduction of downstream siltation; and crucially, watershed protecÂ¬tion. It also notes the potential of forests to support local livelihoods in terms of provision of non-timber forest products (mushrooms, medicinal plants etc.).

Much of Pakistan's forests have now been cleared, increasing the importance of managing what remains under a framework of sustainable use. In particular the sustainable use should benefit marginalised groups such as women and children. Use of existing resources should be complemented with forest restoration activities to attempt to regenerate forests in order to safeguard economic growth.

Approaches to achieve the desired sustainable use of forests include the substitution of firewood and timber (specifically discouraging the use of rare species in government buildings); and the prevention of encroachment on remaining forest lands through regulation of grazing.

In order to finance the protection of watersheds and safeguard Pakistan's water supply, the forest policy stipulates the creation of a forest fund. The fund may also be used to finance the promotion of forestry research and education in Pakistan.

The Policy provides a comprehensive framework for the National Action Plan for adaptation and mitigation. The objectives of the new policy are to pursue sustainable economic growth with a series of measures that appropriately address the challenges of climate change. These measures should integrate climate change policy with interrelated national policies. It is intended that policies should focus on pro-poor and gender-sensitive adaptation while also promoting mitigation. There is an explicit acknowledgement of the risks posed to water, food and energy security posed by climate change; and the need to minimise the risks from the increased frequency and intensity of events like floods and droughts. The policy seeks international finance to support the development required to meet these numerous challenges. However, in addition to directly seeking finance, the policy seeks to create economic incentives to encourage public and private sector investment in adaptation measures and the promotion of conservation of natural resources and long-term sustainability.

All relevant ministries, departments and agencies will have to devise their own plans and programmes to implement policy provisions relating to their sectors. Similarly, the lower levels of government, provincial governments; the regions of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan; federally administrated territories and local governments are expected to establish their own strategies, plans and programmes for NCCP implementation.",PAK,"Agriculture,Residential and Commercial,Energy,LULUCF,Water,Environment",Executive,published,"mitigation, adaptation, DRM/DRR",Policy,"Adaptation, Energy Demand, Energy Supply, Institutions / Administrative arrangements, REDD+ and LULUCF, Research and development, Transportation",""

In 2008 the European Commission proposed binding legislation to implement the 20-20-20 targets. This 'climate and energy package' became law in 2009. The core of the package comprises four pieces of complementary legislation.
The 20-20-20 targets include:
â€¢ Reduction of EU GHG emissions by at least 20% below 1990 levels by 2020
â€¢ 20% of EU energy consumption to come from renewable resources by 2020
â€¢ 20% reduction in primary energy use compared with projected levels, by improving energy efficiency
The EU committed to increase its emissions reduction to 30% by 2020, on condition that other major emitting countries commit to do their fair share under a global climate agreement.
Member States will limit GHG emissions between 2013 and 2020 according to a linear trajectory with binding annual targets. This will ensure a gradual move towards the 2020 targets in sectors where changes take time to implement, such as buildings, infrastructure and transportation. To increase the cost-effectiveness of policies and measures, Member States are allowed to deviate from the linear trajectory to a certain degree.

The Renewable Energy Directive sets the following targets:
â€¢ At least 10% share of renewables in final energy consumption in the transportation sector by 2020
â€¢ The biofuels and bio-liquids should contribute to a reduction of at least 35% of GHG emissions in order to be recognised. From 2017, their share in emissions savings should be increased to 50 %

It was adopted by the European Council in October 2014 as a strategic document, although binding legislation is yet to be drafted. It includes the binding 2030 EU domestic GHG reduction target of at least 40% compared to 1990, as well as a target of at least 27% for final renewable energy, and a at least 27% for energy savings by 2030 (target to be reviewed upwards to 30% in 2020).<br />
In addition, the EU ETS is to be reformed and strengthened. To achieve the 2030 binding 40% reduction target, the sectors covered by the EU ETS would have to reduce their emissions by 43% compared to 2005. In parallel, emissions from non-EU ETS sectors would need to be cut by 30% below the 2005 level, through national measures. To address the surplus of emission allowances in the EU ETS and to improve the system's resilience, a market stability reserve is to be established and the annual factor to reduce the cap on the maximum permitted emissions is to be changed from the current 1.74% to 2.2% from 2021. The volume of free allowances is to be reduced progressively; Member States with a GDP per capita below 60% of the EU average may opt to continue to give free allowances to the energy sector up to 2030, but the maximum amount handed out for free after 2020 should be no more than 40% of the allowances allocated to eligible Member States.<br />
The 2030 Framework stresses the importance of a fully functioning and connected EU energy market, as foreseen in the European Energy Security Strategy (2014).

<br />
The Act allowed for distribution companies and large consumers could buy electricity from generators other than the local one. While the Act limited large-scale production to the existing generators, it also allowed self-generation by industry and CHP production by industrial firms or by joint ventures involving distribution companies. The Act forced distribution companies to take in all electricity that was locally generated and supplied to them, and to pay a feed-in tariff essentially equal to the avoided costs.<br />

The E-Act also established, as of August 1, 1998, DTe, the independent regulator for the energy sector, as a chamber of the Dutch competition authority NMa. DTe was charged with supervising the sector and had the responsibility to guarantee non-discriminatory access to the grid for generators and to regulate the prices of the captive end users. The law forced energy companies to split their tariffs into network tariffs (including systems services) and tariffs for energy use as of the year 2000. DTe regulated the network tariffs and the final tariffs of the captive users, with the law imposing an RPI-X formula and the '1996=2000 principle' stating that overall prices in the year 2000 could not be higher than those that prevailed in 1996.<br />

8574,8574,Law no 1/2005 regulating the greenhouse gas emission rights trading scheme and creating the Climate Change Policy Coordination Commission (CCPCC),"Law 1/2005 translates EU regulations related to the GHG emission rights trading scheme. It further creates the Climate Change Policy Coordination Commission (CCPCC) as a coordination and collaboration body between the General State Administration and the Autonomous Communities for the application of the trade regime of rights of issue and compliance with international and community information obligations inherent to it.

Royal Decree 1823/2011, which restructures the ministerial departments, establishes that the chair of the Commission corresponds to the Secretary of State for the Environment.

The functions entrusted to the Climate Change Policy Coordination Commission are the following: 1) the monitoring of climate change and adaptation to its effects, 2) the prevention and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, 3) the promotion of carbon absorption capacity by plant formations, 4) taking into account the criteria established by the National Climate Council, the establishment of the general lines of action of the National Authority Designated by Spain and the criteria for the approval of mandatory reports on voluntary participation in clean development projects and of joint application of the Kyoto Protocol, 5) the promotion of programs and actions that encourage the reduction of emissions in the sectors and activities not included in the scope of Law 1/2005, 6) the elaboration and approval of technical guidelines and explanatory notes for the harmonization of the application of the emission rights regime, and 7) the development and implementation of a national regime of domestic projects.

The purpose of the Royal Decree No. 1.315 / 2005, taken in order to apply the 2005 law, is to establish the basic rules to be followed by the systems for monitoring and verifying greenhouse gas emissions from authorised facilities in accordance with the law regulating the regime for the trading of gas emission rights Greenhouse.

The purpose of Royal Decree No. 1.264 / 2005 is to establish the rules of organisation and operation of the National Registry of Emission Rights (Renade) in development of the provisions of of Law 1/2005, which regulates the regime of trade in greenhouse gas emission rights in application of the provisions contained in the European regulations on the subject.

The Law No. 13/2010 modifies Law No. 1/2005. Its main objective is to regulate the trading of greenhouse gas emission rights, to encourage reductions in the emissions of these gases in an effective and economically efficient manner.

The Royal Decree No. 101/2011 establishes the basic rules that govern the accreditation and verification systems of greenhouse gas emissions and the tons-kilometer data of the air operators and of the allocation requests free of charge in the scope of Law 1/2005 which regulates the trading regime for greenhouse gas emission rights. It also regulates monitoring and reporting, and verifications of greenhouse gas emissions of the air operators.

The Royal Decree No. 301/2011 determines the mitigation measures that contribute to a reduction in emissions equivalent to that involved in the trading regime of greenhouse gas emission rights for the purpose of excluding it from the trading period that begins in 2013 of hospitals and small facilities. It considers as Small emitters those installations that have notified the competent authority of emissions of less than 25,000 equivalent tons of carbon dioxide, under the terms provided by law, and that, when carrying out combustion activities, have a nominal thermal power of less than 35 MW.

1699,1699,National Action Plan for Climate Change Mitigation,"The National Action Plan for Climate Change Mitigation was approved and adopted by the Governmental Decree No.259. The Action Plan identifies the major policy directions and priorities to reduce GHG emission and adapt to climate change under national policy. This policy functions as the basis for implementation by all levels of governments and sectors.<br />
<br />
The Action Plan starts with an analysis of trends and scenarios of climate change and anthropogenic GHG emissions. The gases subject to analysis are: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and perfluorocarbons. Impacts on water resources are regarded as the key concern in the face of climate change, due to glacier retreat, increase in evaporation and decrease in river flow due to temperature rise. Change in regional hydrological cycles is expected to have destructive impact on the scale and impact of natural disasters. Change in water quality is considered a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity and economy (e.g. irrigation). Vector-born and other dangerous diseases (including malaria), agricultural pests and diseases strong winds and sandstorms, heavy rainfalls, floods and mudflows, high temperature, extreme temperature variation and hot winds derived from climate change are expected to damage agriculture and public health.<br />
<br />
To mitigate such climate change impacts, the proposed approaches are to reduce GHG emissions and to adapt to climate change. The measures to reduce GHGs (as a fulfilment of UNFCCC obligations) include: enhancement of energy efficiency in relevant sectors of the national economy; application of effective technologies and use of energy sources in the national economy (that promotes high economy growth rate and reduce or limit GHG emissions); protection and enhancement of natural sinks and reservoirs of GHGs; promotion of sustainable forest management practices, afforestation and reforestation; promotion of sustainable agriculture; development and research on renewable (and new) energies and environmentally sounds technologies for use; and encouragement of appropriate reforms in relevant sectors aimed at promoting policies and measures that reduce GHG emissions.<br />
<br />
Principles and direction of adaptation include: research on climate change and its impact on national resources, economy public health and development of additional adaptation measures; improvement of the systematic observation network and environmental monitoring to renew adaptation measures; improvement of systems to collect, analyze, interpret and disseminate data among end users; enhancement of weather forecasting, climate modelling and early warning systems to minimize the risk of natural disasters; capacity building to strengthen institutional, technical and human resources to promote adaptation in the fields of climate change and hydrological research, geographical information systems, environmental impact assessment, protection and re-cultivation of lands rational use of water resources, conservation of ecosystems, sustainable agriculture, infrastructure development and health protection; and implementation of actual projects on adaptation on priority areas related to rational use of natural resources, economy and health protection.",TJK,"Agriculture,Residential and Commercial,Economy-wide,Energy,Health,LULUCF,Transportation,Water,Environment",Executive,published,"mitigation, adaptation",Plan,"Adaptation, Energy Demand, Energy Supply, Research and development",""

Renewable energy prices are set by the provider but must not exceed the estimated price stated in the feasibility study submitted to and approved by the appropriate governing body. Those companies operating regional power grids are legally obliged to buy all renewable energy produced by plants connected to the grid up to 50% of their total energy purchases. Should renewable energy exceed 50% of energy purchased by companies operating regional energy grids, the national grid shall purchase the surplus in its entirety. Additional incentives to develop renewable energy projects include prioritising the connection of renewable energy plants to energy grids and the use of renewable energy once those plants have access to the grids, and the exclusion of 'service payments' associated with the sale and purchase of traditionally produced energy.<br />

1416,1416,Law Concerning the Rational Use of Energy (Energy Conservation Act) (Law No.49 of 1979),"The Law is the pillar of Japanese energy conservation policy as well as one of the two key climate law. It was enacted in 1979 in the light of the oil shock with a purpose of promoting effective and rational use of energy. It covers the following sectors: energy management in the industrial, commercial, residential and transportation sectors; energy efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances. The subjects of the Law are factories and workplaces that consume more than 1,500kL of oil equivalent energy annually. Among factories, there are two categories: Factory I that uses more than 3,000kL equivalent; and Factory II that uses between 1,500-3,000kL equivalent. Currently, it covers approximately 90% of the operators in the industrial sector.<br />
<br />
Energy defined under this Law covers energies derived from oil, natural gas, coals, heat (fossil-derived) and other sources of energy derived from the above. Electricity derived from renewable sources such as solar PV, wind and biomass are not subject for this Law. Designated businesses are required to produce reports (regular reporting for Factory II, both regular and mid-term reporting for Factory I) to the Energy Agency of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry. The purpose of this is to report amount of fuel, heat and electricity used in the subject period. Reduction target of 1% on average is set out under the law, with a fine up to JPY1m (USD8,495) according to the violation.<br />
<br />
This Law also mandates an appointment of licensed energy managers for the designated businesses. Other measures include energy efficiency standards for vehicles and appliances, energy conservation labelling, energy regulation for housing and building and Positive Evaluation of Action to Reduce Peak Demand Electricity.<br />

<br />
The Strategic Framework underpinning the policy addresses both the supply and demand energy issues Jamaica faces. It prioritises seven key areas:<br />
â€¢ Security of energy supply through diversification of fuels as well as development of renewable energy sources<br />
â€¢ Modernising the country's energy infrastructure<br />
â€¢ Development of renewable energy sources<br />
â€¢ Conservation and efficiency in energy use<br />
â€¢ Development of a comprehensive governance/regulatory framework for the energy sector<br />
â€¢ Enabling government ministries and agencies to be models/best practice for the rest of society in terms of energy management<br />
â€¢ Eco-efficiency in industries<br />
<br />
Finding environmentally sustainable energy solutions is central to the document. It seeks to facilitate cultural, institutional and technological change in a way that supports 'aggressive' advances in energy efficiency and conservation, minimises greenhouse emissions and ultiÂ¬mately provides green growth. These energy efficiency and conservation goals are seen as 'no regrets' mitigation actions that can have positive impacts on society and the economy, principally by reducing costs and dependency on fossil fuel imports.<br />

1365,1365,Smarter Travel - A Sustainable Transport Future: A New Transport Policy for Ireland 2009-2020,"This document reflects the government's vision and required measures to have a sustainable transport system by 2020. It sets out below five goals:<br />
â€¢ To reduce overall travel demand<br />
â€¢ To maximize the efficiency of the transport network<br />
â€¢ To reduce reliance on fossil fuels<br />
â€¢ To reduce transport emissions<br />
â€¢ To improve accessibility to transport<br />
<br />
In order to achieve these goals and ultimately ensure that sustainable travel and transport is in place by 2020, the following key targets are proposed:<br />
â€¢ Future population and employment growth will take place predominantly in sustainable compact forms, which would reduce the need to travel for employment and services<br />
â€¢ 500,000 more people will make alternative means to commute and total share of car commuting will drop from 65% to 45%<br />
â€¢ Support and provide alternative methods such as walking, cycling and public transport, to rise the share to 55% of total commuter journeys to work<br />
â€¢ Total kilometres travelled by the car fleets in 2020 will not increase significantly from current levels<br />
â€¢ Reduction of GHG emission from transport sector will be achieved compared to the 2005 level<br />
<br />
Following these objectives and targets, following key actions are proposed:<br />

The GNEP is based on seven core principles:<br />
â€¢ Energy Security;<br />
â€¢ Energy Independence;<br />
â€¢ Energy Efficiency;<br />
â€¢ Energy Conservation;<br />
â€¢ Environmental Sustainability;<br />
â€¢ Sustainable Resource Exploitation;<br />
â€¢ Rational Energy Prices; and<br />
â€¢ Energy Equity and Solidarity, including with future generations.<br />
<br />
The GNEP further calls for a minimum of a 20% reduction of GHG emissions from fossil fuel combustion below â€˜Business As Usual' by 2020, and it sets a specific target for renewable energy: to provide 20% of all domestic energy used for electricity and transport by 2020. It also calls for the implementation of various measures to encourage energy efficiency and conservation in energy generation, transport and buildings sectors â€”although it does not include specific targets.<br />
<br />
In particular, the GNEP calls for a set of specific projects to be co-ordinated by the Government by 2020:<br />
â€¢ Complete feasibility and construct a 20MW geothermal plant<br />
â€¢ Construct an additional 20MW geothermal plant<br />
â€¢ Construct a 2.5MW wind turbine for Carriacou<br />
â€¢ Achieve 10% electricity generation by wind & solar PV<br />
â€¢ Establish vehicle fuel efficiency standards<br />
â€¢ Achieve 20% market penetration with hybrid and electric vehicles.<br />
<br />
It also demands the establishment of the necessary international structures, including a National Energy Commission representing relevant stakeholders that would 'review the achievement of the policy targets, receive comments from stakeholders (â€¦) and feed this information back to government, recommending solutions where necessary'.<br />
<br />
Finally, it offers a layout of a 10-year Grenada Energy Development Strategy (2010-2020), which provides for adoption of energy specific legislation such as Energy Efficiency Act, Geothermal Bill, and revision of the Electricity Supply Act. The proposed Energy Efficiency Act includes the following provisions:<br />
â€¢ Mandate commercial building planning regulations(e.g. mandatory renewable sources contribution to energy consumption for new buildings);<br />
â€¢ Require the use of energy efficiency standards and building codes for ventilation, cooling, water- and process-heating, lighting and in institutional, commercial and industrial buildings;<br />
â€¢ Require all government buildings of a certain size to have periodic energy audits and compliance audits;<br />
â€¢ Mandate the compilation and publication of sectoral benchmarking data (e.g., kWh per hotel room-night for the hotels sector);<br />
â€¢ Require commercial banks to provide financial incentives for investments in energy efficiency to businesses and homeowners;<br />
â€¢ Mandate specified fuel efficiencies for imported vehicles;<br />
â€¢ Require training in 'eco-driving' practices for public and private sector organisations;<br />
â€¢ Develop, monitor, publish and update indicators of national energy consumption and efficiency.<br />

The most recent version of the CO2 Act is a full revision of the 2000 CO2 Act, which has been partially revised several times, and a response to the need for post-2012 climate legislation until 2020.

The revision of 1 January 2013 sets out a number of targets, measures and strategies to address climate change via emission reductions in Switzerland, including market-based carbon trading mechanisms. Key aspects are:
- Emission reductions by 20% by 2020 below 1990 with domestic measures (possibly 30% depending on other nation's commitments); any increase beyond the -20% reduction can be met up to 75% with measures carried out abroad
- CO2 levy on thermal fuels 3 ct/l (CHF12 (USD12.5)/ t CO2) since 2008 and 9 ct/l (CHF36/t CO2 USD39.7/t CO2) since 2010 and CHF60 (USD62.7) since 2014 with further increases up to 30ct./l (CHF120(USD125.4)/tCO2) if predefined intermediate objectives for the emission reduction pathway until 2020 are not met
- The annual revenue of approximately CHF800m (USD835.8m) is to be redistributed to taxpayers and companies, with one third and not more than CHF300m (USD313.4m) to be channelled to the buildings programme and not more than CHF25m (USD26.1m) to the technology fund.
- CO2 emission limits for new cars (compatible with EU regulations).
- If companies join a binding agreement to reduce their energy-related CO2 emissions, there is the possibility to exempt companies from the CO2-levy
- Compensation of emissions from transportation sector via domestic projects
- National emission trading scheme, which can be linked with the European Emission Trading Scheme
- Co-ordination of domestic adaptation measures on the Federal level

Reform of the Swiss ETS post-2012 to allow comparable situations for Swiss and EU companies and improve cost efficiency of emission trading
- Prepare linking with EU ETS
- Determine total cap and trade emission allowances for 2013-2020 with an annual reduction of allowances by 1.74%
- Sanctioning of each ton CO2 not covered by credit with CHF125(USD130.6) and obligation to surrender missing emission credits for the following year
- Carbon leakage sectors enjoy free allocation of emission allowances (up to benchmark), the free allocation for non-carbon leakage sectors is decreased and allowances are auctioned
- The Swiss ETS covers among others energy supply, processing of mineral oil, production and processing of metals, glass, ceramic, cement, production of paper, production of chemical products
- Expected coverage is 30-40 companies emitting 4-5 MtCO2, compulsory for large emitters with over > 25'000 tCO2/year and a voluntary opt-in for medium size emitters (above 10 MW); companies participating in the emissions trading scheme are automatically exempted from the CO2 levy

Measures in the transportation sector include the obligation for motor fuel importers to domestically offset CO2 emitted by the transportation sector (5-40%) and emission limits for new passenger cars.

Emissions in the buildings sector are to be reduced by technical prescriptions for buildings, a CO2 levy on fossil fuels and earmarking of the CO2 levy for the national buildings programme (financing the renovation of buildings). The Buildings programme aims to reduce CO2 emissions via lower energy use in buildings and support for renewable energy sources. One third of the revenues (and no more than CHF300m USD313.4m) from the CO2 tax and cantonal funds are channelled into the Building programme. Two updates of the programme were necessary as a result of its popularity. These aim at accommodating the 48,000 applications that were received since 2010.

The 2000 CO2 Act focused on meeting the Kyoto Protocol commitment of overall GHG emission reductions of 8% in the 2008 - 2012 period compared to the 1990 base line. The CO2 Act set an emission reduction objective of 10% for CO2 emissions for the period 2008-12 compared to 1990 levels (CO2 emissions represent around 80% of Switzerland's GHG emissions under the Kyoto Protocol). It contained a number of policy measures, which were further specified in action plans, programmes and policies and have been amended based on the changes to the CO2 Act since 2000.
Those include:
- CO2 levy for thermal fuels
- Climate cent on transportation fuels
- Voluntary commitments
- Cross-cutting measures in areas suitable to climate policy integration

Based on the Spatial Planning Act was developed the National Concept for Spatial Development for 2013-2025 (5 November 2012), which outlines the directions for land-use planning, governance and protection of the national territory and creates preconditions for spatial orientation and coordination of sectorial policies. The main objective of the Concept is 'spatial co-ordination of the processes in the national territory through establishing a spatial and land-use planning base and a regulator for implementation of both regional planning and individual socio-economic sectoral planning at the national level in the context of the common European spatial development for the purposes of achieving complex integrated planning'. The Concept integrates climate change mitigation and adaptation concerns, especially through considering among the major directions of development of the agrarian and forestry sector 'sustainable use and management of natural resources - promotion of practices contributing to adaptation to climate change and compatible with protection and improvement of the environment, natural resources, soils and genetic diversity', taking into account the GHG emissions reduction potential of forests, as well as the importance of spatial planning for improving climate adaptation capacity (e.g. reduction of occurrence of natural disasters).",BGR,"LULUCF,Urban",Legislative,published,,Law,"Adaptation, Institutions / Administrative arrangements, REDD+ and LULUCF",""

In its part on combined heat and power generation introduces the requirements of the related EU directives and the use of instruments such as green certificates and preferential feed in tariffs and mandates the state regulations to the licensed activities in the power sector and purchase obligations for the Transmission and Distribution Companies of all electricity produced from high efficient cogeneration, and for district heating companies to buy all utilised waste thermal energy.<br />
<br />
The Act also mandates regular production of the National Energy Strategy. The most recent one, Energy Strategy of the Republic of Bulgaria until 2020 was published in 2011. The Energy strategy is worked out by the Ministry of Economy, Energy and Tourism and approved by the Council of Ministers.<br />
<br />
The present National Energy Strategy till 2020 reflects the up-to-date European energy policy framework and the global trends in the development of energy technologies. The main priorities in the Energy Strategy are:<br />
â€¢ 'to guarantee the security of energy supply<br />
â€¢ to attain the targets for renewable energy<br />
â€¢ to increase the energy efficiency<br />
â€¢ to develop a competitive energy market and policy for the purpose of meeting the energy needs<br />
â€¢ to protect the interests of the consumers'<br />
<br />
These priorities also determine the Government's vision for development of the energy, namely:<br />
â€¢ maintaining a safe, stable and reliable energy system<br />
â€¢ keeping the energy sector a leading branch of the economy with definite orientation to foreign trade<br />
â€¢ focus on clean and low-emission energy - from nuclear and renewable sources<br />
â€¢ balance between quantity, quality and prices of the electric power produced from renewable sources, nuclear energy, coal and natural gas<br />
â€¢ transparent, efficient and highly professional management of the energy companies<br />
<br />
The strategy also lays down the main national targets for the energy sector: 16% share of energy from renewables in gross final energy consumption by 2020; 10% share of energy from renewables in the gross final energy consumption in transport by 2020; and energy efficiency increase by 25% by 2020.",BGR,"Economy-wide,Energy,Transportation,Waste",Legislative,published,,Law,"Energy Demand, Energy Supply",""

The NREAP supersedes and overwrites the preceding target and renewable energy policy, and aims to increase renewable energy within the total gross energy consumption by 14.65% by 2020. In addition, there is a target of renewable energy accounting for 4.3% of gross final consumption of energy in 2005.<br />
<br />
The NREAP identifies significant potential in renewable energy sources, but many of them face environmental concerns as barriers and funding limitation. Some 16-17MW of hydropower could realistically be installed by 2020, but environmental concerns are limiting factors. Wind energy potential reaches several thousand MW, while also considered environmentally friendly, but it needs economic justification as it is highly intermittent. Geothermal energy potential in Hungary exceeds the global average but lack of funding is a significant barrier. Solar energy potential amounts to several tens of thousands of MW, but the most significant limiting factor is large investment cost. Heat pumps have theoretical potential of several hundred PJ, but face funding limitations. Biogas production potential in theory could exceed as much as 20% of energy demand for 2020. Biofuels have significant potential, but are limited by the financial burden of replacing current vehicles. The target trajectory of renewable energy by end use in 2020 is to increase to: 18.9% of heating and cooling; 10.9% of electricity; and 10% of transport.<br />
