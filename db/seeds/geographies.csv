The President should enact a law within 30 days of receiving it; within this period, the President can ask the National Assembly to reconsider the legislation. If, after this reconsideration, a two-thirds majority of the Members approve the legislation, the President must enact it within 15 days. The President also issues Presidential legislative decrees, provisional Presidential legislative decrees, Presidential decrees, and Presidential dispatches, which are published in the Diário da República (Official Gazette).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The National Assembly is the parliament, a unicameral body, with 220 members. The members are elected for five years according to a system of proportional representation, where 130 members are elected at national level, and 90 members are elected by provincial districts (five members for each province). After the first election for the National Assembly was held in 1992, the following election, scheduled for 1997, was delayed on numerous occasions until it was eventually held in 2008.

The Federal Parliament is bicameral, consisting of the House of Representatives (the Lower House), and the Senate (the Upper House). The Senate is composed of equal numbers of representatives from all six Australian states, with additional Senators representing Australian Terri­tories (76 in total). Senators are elected for six-year terms. In the House of Representatives, the number of members of parliament per state is proportional to population (currently 150 members). Members are elected for three-year terms. The most recent election was in July 2016 with the next expected in 2019. Australia retains the Sovereign of the United Kingdom as its head of state. All laws are formally enacted by the Sovereign (Royal Assent) as a formality after passage through Parliament.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Proposed laws are called bills, and can be introduced into either House, except for bills that propose expenditure or tax levies (appropriation or money bills), which must be introduced in the House of Representatives. In practice, most bills are introduced in the House of Representatives. All bills must be passed (by a series of three readings) by both Houses to become law (Acts). It is possible for the Senate to block the passage of legislation even when the gov­ernment has a clear majority in the House of Representatives. In the case of parliamentary deadlock, the constitution allows the Governor-General (the Sovereign’s representative) to authorise a “double dissolution” election under specific circumstances, at the request of the Prime Minister.</p>

The Parliament, jointly with the King who heads the federal executive, have the right of legislative initiative. The Constitutional Court is the highest judicial body. On the federal level, the bicameral Parliament consists of a Senate representing the federated entities (60 seats; 50 senators from federated entities, 10 co-opted; elected for a five-year term) and a House of Representatives representing the citizens (150 seats; members directly elected by popular vote for a five-year term; proportional representation). The last federal election was held on 25 May 2014, and the next is scheduled for 2019.</p>

In addition, an ‘Agreement on Co-operation’ can be adopted among the federated entities and the national government, and is often used in climate change policy in cases where actions need to be co-ordinated at the national level. A draft Act is voted in plenary session of one or both of the Parliament Chambers depending on its content. It is then transmitted to the King, who gives his assent and promulgates the Act after countersignature by the relevant Minister.

The bill is assigned one or more sponsors in the plenary session where again it will be debated. The chamber may decide to send the bill back to the committee whenever its text becomes significantly different from the one originally submitted.

Most often, the Commission proposes new legislation, but it is the Council and Parliament together that pass the laws.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The main forms of EU legislation are directives, regulations and decisions. Directives and regulations can be adopted by the Council in conjunction with the European Parliament or by the Commission alone. A regulation is a general measure that is binding in all its parts, directly appli­cable in the Member States and addressed to everyone. A directive, on the other hand, is addressed to the member states. It is binding as to the result to be achieved, but leaves member states to choose the form and method they adopt to achieve it. The Commission is required to verify that member states transpose correctly and in due time the directives that have been adopted and can sanction them if they fail to do so. Decisions are EU laws relating to specific cases. They can be adopted by the Council (sometimes jointly with the European Parliament) or by the Commission.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Commission can also publish Action Plans, White Papers, Green Papers, Commission regulations and Communications. An Action Plan serves to detail actions needed to reach the goals set in individual directives. A White Paper sets out the Commission’s policy programme in a specific area. Before a White Paper is written, a Green Paper is published, which is a consultative document including suggestions and options for new policy. Each single proposal for legislation announced in a White Paper or deriving from a policy initiative announced in it is subject to one or more rounds of open consultation and an impact assessment. White Papers, Green Papers and Communications can serve to identify future legislative proposals. Commission regulations primarily serve as administrative acts on the functioning of the EU Institutions. The Treaty of Lisbon (2009) created a new category of legislation, Delegated Acts, by which, under strict conditions, the legislator can delegate to the Commission the power to adopt acts amending non-essential elements of a legislative act, in particular to specify certain technical details.</p>","true","28 nation states","G20","-",,,"published"

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Legislation can be initiated by a single member of the Knesset, a group of Knesset members (these would be called private bills), by a Knesset committee, or by the government. A bill requires three readings to pass. After the first reading, it is referred to a committee for preparation for the second reading. The committee may propose amendments as long as they do not diverge from the subject of the bill. The voting on second reading is performed article by article. At this stage the bill may be returned to the Committee, to draft any reservations adopted in second reading, or be put immediately to the vote in third reading. Until the bill is adopted in third reading, the government is entitled to withdraw it.</p>

Draft bills or resolutions, respectively proposing either new laws or revisions to existing legislature, are introduced to Parliament either (most commonly) upon the proposal of the government, or by individual Members of Parliament. Propositions made by the government undergo a lengthy initial process of inter-agency input and debate, being formally prepared by the relevant ministry and presented to the monarch for approval before being sent to Parliament. The Parliament in turn refers bills and resolutions to the relevant standing committee (of which there are 12). These committees consider each bill and resolution in detail and often make changes to them before presenting any recommendations on legislative matters to Parliament for a vote. A bill can be read to Parliament and voted on up to three times before a final decision is reached. In order for an approved bill to be enacted, it must be signed by the monarch, in a process known as ‘Royal Assent’, and counter-signed by the Prime Minister. The constitution technically grants the monarch the right to withhold Royal Assent, though this has never occurred in modern history and the constitution allows for any royal veto to be ultimately overridden by Parliament.</p>
