The government is divided into Executive, Legislative and Judicial Branches. The President, elected by direct and popular vote, every five years, serves as both the Chief Executive and the Commander in Chief. The President appoints the Prime Minister, who serves as the head of the Government. The constitution was enacted in 1963 and has been amended on a number of occasions, most recently in 2008. In May 2014, following President Abdelazziz Bouteflika’s re-election, the Government released a constitutional reform package.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The legislative authority is held and exercised by a bicameral Parliament composed of the Council of the Nation (the upper house or Senate) and the National People’s Assembly (the lower house). The Council of the Nation, first instituted in 1997, consists of 144 seats, one third of which are appointed by the President and the remaining two thirds are elected by indirect vote of the elected members of communal assemblies and <em>wilayas</em> (provinces). Members serve for six-year terms and half of the Council is renewed every three years. The last Council of the Nation election was in 2012, and the next anticipated election is 2017. The National People’s Assembly is currently 462 seats, up from 389 during the last term, all of which are elected by popular vote to serve five-year terms. The most recent National People’s Assembly election was 2012 and the next anticipated election is in 2017.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Laws are first put forth by the National People’s Assembly and must be adopted by both houses; although the Council of the Nation has the absolute power to block the Legislative process, it neither has the authority to initiate legislation nor amend it. Prior to adoption, a bill is first successively debated in the National People’s Assembly then the Council of the Nation.  Bills are adopted by a majority of three quarters of the members. In the event of a disagreement among the houses, a joint committee is created, composed of members of both houses, to propose a revised text, which is then subject to the approval of both houses and is not amendable.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">When the National People’s Assembly is in recess, the President can legislate by ordinance; however, the President must present the text of the order/decree to both houses during the next session for approval. Ordinances not approved by both houses are considered obsolete. Presidential decrees do not have to be approved by both houses during a presidentially declared ‘state of emergency’. Algeria operated under a ‘state of emergency’ for 19 years, until it was officially lifted in February 2011.</p>",false,,"G77, The Arab Group",published

Among its duties, the President of the Republic shall enact the laws of the National Assembly. The President should enact a law within 30 days of receiving it; within this period, the President can ask the National Assembly to reconsider the legislation. If, after this reconsideration, a two-thirds majority of the Members approve the legislation, the President must enact it within 15 days. The President also issues Presidential legislative decrees, provisional Presidential legislative decrees, Presidential decrees, and Presidential dispatches, which are published in the Diário da República (Official Gazette).</p>

After the first election for the National Assembly was held in 1992, the following election, scheduled for 1997, was delayed on numerous occasions until it was eventually held in 2008.

The National Congress is composed of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Each of the 23 provinces (and the autonomous federal capital, Buenos Aires) elects three senators (two from the majority party and one from the first minority) for a total of 72 senators. The 257 representatives of the Chamber of Deputies are elected by congressional districts based on proportional representation. The last legislative elections were held in October 2015 and the next is expected for 2019.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Legislative proposals are called law projects and are generally introduced in the Chamber of Deputies before debate and vote in the Senate. To become law, all bills must be passed by both congressional bodies and signed by the President, who acts as both head of state and head of government.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A law project is first drafted, proposed and debated in legislative committees in the Chamber of Deputies. Often included in the committee debate is expert testimony. Once the proposal has passed the relevant legislative committee, it is officially presented and debated by all deputies, and amendments may be considered. Once passed by both chambers of congress, the President promulgates, vetoes or partially vetoes the legislation within 10 working days. A presidential veto can be overridden with a two thirds majority in both chambers of congress.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Argentina is a federal republic made up of 23 provinces and an autonomous national capital city. Each province elects its own governor and congress and is granted significant authority over the running of its territory. While federal law usurps provincial law, many of the laws passed by National Congress and enacted by the President are written to coexist with provincial law. Some provinces have passed legislation directly or indirectly related to climate change. Article 41 of the Argentine National Constitution declares the importance of the natural environ­ment and its protection from contamination a national priority. It considers “enjoyment” of the natural environment an individual and cultural right. Constitutionally, each province has the gubernatorial authority to legislate and control its natural resources; however, the national government is granted authority to establish norms and standards for the protection of the environment.</p>",true,"23 provinces, 1 autonomous city","G20, G77",published

The Federal Parliament is bicameral, consisting of the House of Representatives (the Lower House), and the Senate (the Upper House). The Senate is composed of equal numbers of representatives from all six Australian states, with additional Senators representing Australian Terri­tories (76 in total). Senators are elected for six-year terms. In the House of Representatives, the number of members of parliament per state is proportional to population (currently 150 members). Members are elected for three-year terms. The most recent election was in July 2016 with the next expected in 2019. Australia retains the Sovereign of the United Kingdom as its head of state. All laws are formally enacted by the Sovereign (Royal Assent) as a formality after passage through Parliament.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Proposed laws are called bills, and can be introduced into either House, except for bills that propose expenditure or tax levies (appropriation or money bills), which must be introduced in the House of Representatives. In practice, most bills are introduced in the House of Representatives. All bills must be passed (by a series of three readings) by both Houses to become law (Acts). It is possible for the Senate to block the passage of legislation even when the gov­ernment has a clear majority in the House of Representatives. In the case of parliamentary deadlock, the constitution allows the Governor-General (the Sovereign’s representative) to authorise a “double dissolution” election under specific circumstances, at the request of the Prime Minister.</p>

Legislative powers rest with the Federal Assembly, consisting of two chambers: the National Council (Nationalrat) and the Federal Council (Bundesrat).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The National Council has 183 members. Its members are elected for five years, using a proportional representation system. In the most recent parliamentary elections in 2013 the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÖ) came first, closely followed by the Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) and the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ). The Greens, Team Stronach and NEOS are also represented in Parliament.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Federal Council has 61 members and its main function is to represent the provinces and their interests at the federal level. However, unlike the National Council, its members are not elected by direct popular vote. Instead, they are delegated by the federal states, in proportion to the relative strengths of the parties in the provincial legislatures. The number of members delegated by each state depends on its size: the most populous province sends 12 members to the Federal Council; the smallest province delegates three members.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Passing federal legislation involves both chambers of the Federal Assembly. However, most powers lie with the National Council. The legislative process begins with a bill being introduced into the National Council, most commonly by the government and its ministers. Less commonly, Private Members, the Federal Council and National Council committees can also introduce bills, and bills can be initiated by popular demand. Once a bill has been introduced to parliament, it is assigned to a committee or the National Council may – on very rare occasions – hold a first reading, involving a plenary discussion of the whole house.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The relevant committee deliberates on the bill and often amendments are made to the draft text. Once a bill has been approved by a majority of the committee’s members, a report is drawn up, detailing the discussions and changes made. Then the bill is passed back to the plenary for a second reading, and the different parliamentary groups can state their opinions and propose further changes. At the end of the second reading, the National Council votes on the bill, and on any amendments. A bill passes if at least one third of Council members are present and a simple majority votes in favour. The entire bill is then put to a vote in a third and final reading.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">After the National Council enacts a bill, it is referred to the Federal Council for approval. While the Federal Council cannot amend the proposed legislation, it can reject it by means of a reasoned objection. However, with a few exceptions, the Federal Council has only a “suspensive veto” and cannot prevent a bill from being passed into law.</p>",true,9 Bundesländer,"EU, OECD",published

The remaining 50 seats are reserved for women, and these positions are selected by either the ruling party, or the ruling coalition. All laws are subject to the limits of the constitution and its provisions, such that any law conflicting with the constitution is void. Statutory law is made by Parliament. Laws are proposed, prepared and processed by the executive, which is the Cabinet. The Prime Minister is the head of state, elected by Parliament.

In addition, an ‘Agreement on Co-operation’ can be adopted among the federated entities and the national government, and is often used in climate change policy in cases where actions need to be co-ordinated at the national level.

It consists of the Senate (105 members appointed by the governor general on the advice of the prime minister) and the House of Commons (308 members elected for a maximum of five years). Representation in both chambers is according to population in the provinces. General elections are held on the third Monday of October of the fourth calendar year after the previous poll. They can also be called by the prime minister if the government loses the confidence of the legislature. The last federal election was held in October 2015 and the next is expected for 2019, unless the Governor General dissolves Parliament earlier.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The law-making process starts with a bill, which can be introduced in the House of Commons (C-bills) or the Senate (S-bills). Public bills may be initiated by a minister (government bills) or private members. Private bills are founded on a petition signed by those interested in promoting it and introduced in either chamber. Bills that seem to be both public and private in nature are called hybrid bills. Bills to appropriate any part of the public revenue, such as tax or impost, shall originate in the House of commons (“money votes”). A bill goes through certain formal stages in each House. The stages include a series of three readings during which parliamentarians debate the bill. Prior to the third and final reading, each House also sends the bill to a committee where members examine the finer points of the legislation. Committee members hear witness testimony on the bill, and then subject it to a clause-by-clause study based on the testimony. Canada retains the Sovereign of the United Kingdom as its head of state. All laws are formally enacted by the Sovereign “by and with the advice and consent” of the Senate and House of Commons. Once both Houses have approved a bill, it is presented for Royal Assent and becomes law (named Act or Regulation).</p>

It is a multiparty republic with a presidential system based on the 1980 constitution. The constitution sets the format for the National Congress, composed of a Senate and a Chamber of Deputies. The Senate has 47 members (38 elected and nine appointed) who serve eight-year terms. The Chamber of Deputies has 120 members who are directly elected for 4 years. The last Congressional election was held in 2013, the next is scheduled for 2017. A Bill replacing the Binomial Electoral System and adjusting the number of legislators (to 155 Deputies and 50 Senators) is currently awaiting publication and should take effect from the 2017 election.

The President can also call the legislature into extraordinary session, during which only legislative and treaty proposals introduced by the President can be considered. The President may grant certain initiatives priority status, requiring that Congress act within 3, 10, or 30 days, depending on the degree of urgency. In this sense, the President has the exclusive power to set the legislative agenda.</p>

Congress adopts the laws or statutes, with an internal hierarchy depending on quorum of approval and regulated matter: institutional act, special act, and ordinary act (including decree laws, delegated laws and ordinary laws, all of which are of equal hierarchy). The executive branch enacts regulations (supreme decrees), which are issued by the President of the Republic, and plain decrees or resolutions, which are issued by the rest of the executive branches. A bill, once approved first by the Chamber of Deputies and then the Senate, is sent to the President for approval. Upon endorsement of the bill, the President issues a decree of promulgation and submits the bill for con­stitutional review by the Comptroller-General.

A directive, on the other hand, is addressed to the member states. It is binding as to the result to be achieved, but leaves member states to choose the form and method they adopt to achieve it. The Commission is required to verify that member states transpose correctly and in due time the directives that have been adopted and can sanction them if they fail to do so. Decisions are EU laws relating to specific cases. They can be adopted by the Council (sometimes jointly with the European Parliament) or by the Commission.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Commission can also publish Action Plans, White Papers, Green Papers, Commission regulations and Communications. An Action Plan serves to detail actions needed to reach the goals set in individual directives. A White Paper sets out the Commission’s policy programme in a specific area.

Each single proposal for legislation announced in a White Paper or deriving from a policy initiative announced in it is subject to one or more rounds of open consultation and an impact assessment. White Papers, Green Papers and Communications can serve to identify future legislative proposals. Commission regulations primarily serve as administrative acts on the functioning of the EU Institutions.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A general election must be held at least once every five years. Because the constitution specifies that there must be at least one deputy for every 20,000 to 30,000 people, the number of deputies elected varies with the country’s demographic data, registered in the census every five years.

The first stage involves the initiation of bills. With three exceptions, bills can be initiated in either House, although traditionally bills begin in the House of Representatives. The exceptions are bills related to finance and amendment of the Constitution, which may only be initiated in the House of Representatives, and private bills, which may only come from the Senate. In the second stage the content of the bill is discussed, although no amendments to the text may be made at this point. If successful, in the third stage, the bill undergoes a more detailed examination and a legislative committee proposes amendments. The fourth stage involves a review of the amendments from stage three, but not a re-examination of the rest of the bill. The fifth and final stage of forming legislation involves a debate around the desirability of enacting the finalised bill. If the bill successfully passes through each stage, it is sent to the other House (usually from Lower to Upper Houses) where the process is repeated from stage two onwards. Amendments are then sent back and considered by the initiating House. Amendments may be agreed to, rejected or themselves amended. Once the bill has passed through both houses, the President brings it into force as an Act by signing it. The President cannot veto a bill that both chambers have adopted, although he or she may refer it to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality.

The committee may propose amendments as long as they do not diverge from the subject of the bill. The voting on second reading is performed article by article.

The text approved by Parliament is submitted to the President for assent. If the President signs the bill, it is published and becomes a law. The President can return the bill to the Speaker of the National Assembly to be considered again by Parliament.

Bills that pass the House of Representatives are referred to the Senate. The Senate may choose not to pass the bill.

Once the preparatory work is completed by one or more ministries, the bill is discussed in the Cabinet. If accepted, it is sent to the Monarch’s secretariat, in their capacity as Head of State. From there the bill is sent to the Council of State (of which the Monarch is the President) for advice. This body chiefly pays attention to the legal quality of the bill and generally does not concern itself with political merit. Its report is sent directly to the relevant Minister(s) who, in turn, must respond with a more detailed report to the Monarch. The bill is then presented to the Lower House, which consigns the bill to a committee, where it is discussed and potentially amended, before being debated in plenary and then passed to the Upper House. The Upper House has no right of amendment; it must either accept or reject the bill. Once the Monarch and Minister(s) responsible have signed the Act, it is published in the Bulletin of Acts, Orders and Decrees. Unless the Act decrees otherwise, it comes into force on the first day of the second calendar month following its date of publication.</p>",false,,"EU, OECD",published
127,New Zealand,NZL,National,East Asia & Pacific,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">New Zealand’s parliamentary system is unicameral – it has only one chamber (House of Representatives) and there is no upper house.  The members of the House of Representatives serve a term of three years and are elected using the mixed member proportional representation voting system, whereby each citizen of voting age gets two votes. The first is for a local Member of Parliament, the second for a political party. Typically, the House of Representatives has 120 members. However, this can vary because the representation of political parties is proportional to the number of votes they receive in the general elections. The most recent general election was in September 2014, with the next general election needing to be held before the end of November 2017.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Proposed laws are called bills and are introduced to the House of Representatives. The legislative process begins with a first reading in the House of Representatives. The bill is debated and a decision is reached on whether it progresses to the next stage or not. If a bill passes the first reading, it is usually referred to a select committee to be considered in more detail. In a second reading, the bill and any changes recommended by the select committee are again considered by the House. If successful, all the changes made are worked into the bill before it is considered for a final reading, typically in the form of a summing-up debate. The bill is then put to a vote to either pass or reject it. A bill does not become an Act of Parliament until it is signed by the Sovereign of New Zealand or his/her representative (the Governor-General). This is called the Royal Assent.</p>

The Parliament’s 169 members are directly elected by a system of proportional representation for four-year terms. It is led by a presidium consisting of a President and five vice-presidents. This system replaced a bicameral one during the country’s 2009 election. The most recent election was held in 2013, with the next scheduled for 2017.<br />
Draft bills or resolutions, respectively proposing either new laws or revisions to existing legislature, are introduced to Parliament either (most commonly) upon the proposal of the government, or by individual Members of Parliament. Propositions made by the government undergo a lengthy initial process of inter-agency input and debate, being formally prepared by the relevant ministry and presented to the monarch for approval before being sent to Parliament. The Parliament in turn refers bills and resolutions to the relevant standing committee (of which there are 12). These committees consider each bill and resolution in detail and often make changes to them before presenting any recommendations on legislative matters to Parliament for a vote. A bill can be read to Parliament and voted on up to three times before a final decision is reached. In order for an approved bill to be enacted, it must be signed by the monarch, in a process known as ‘Royal Assent’, and counter-signed by the Prime Minister. The constitution technically grants the monarch the right to withhold Royal Assent, though this has never occurred in modern history and the constitution allows for any royal veto to be ultimately overridden by Parliament.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">As well as proposing bills and resolutions, the government may also submit White Papers to the Parliament, which either report on an issue within a particular field or outline future government policy. They are drawn up when the government wishes to present matters to the Parliament that do not require a decision. These documents, and the subsequent discussion of them in the Parliament, often form the basis of a draft resolution or bill at a later stage.</p>

In order for a bill to become law, both Houses must approve it. A bill can be introduced by a Minister, a Deputy Minister, a parliamentary committee or an individual MP. However, most bills are drawn up by a government department under the direction of the relevant Minister or Deputy Minister. The majority of bills are introduced in the National Assembly, but certain bills that affect provinces may be introduced in the NCOP. The law-making process usually starts with the introduction of a Green Paper – a discussion document drafted by the relevant department that is then subject to public consultation. The Green Paper may be followed by a White Paper, a more developed discussion document that broadly outlines government policy and may also be subject to review by interested parties. Once introduced, a bill is referred to the relevant committee, where it is debated in detail and, if necessary, amended. Then the House takes a decision on whether to pass the bill.

Bills can also be submitted by a relevant ministry. Other ministries will be consulted and a public notice will be issued. The bill is then reviewed by the Ministry of Legislation (MOLEG), an independent and specialised self-legislative control agency within the government in order to exercise overall control of and co-ordinate the government’s legislative activities and to review whether individual bills contravene higher laws or conflict with relevant laws. The bill is deliberated at the State Council and sent for presidential approval. After that it is submitted to the National Assembly for decision.

174,Switzerland,CHE,National,Europe & Central Asia,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Switzerland is a federal state with 26 cantons that enjoy far-reaching autonomy. The government, parliament and courts are organised across the federal level, the cantonal level and the communal level. There is a strong tradition of subsidiarity in the form of cantonal and communal self-determination and self-governance. The federal level aims to establish a minimal amount of national standards and holds responsibility for supra-cantonal policy areas. In consequence, constitutional law states that legislative power rests with the sovereign cantons unless it is explicitly assigned to the federal level.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Swiss Parliament consists of two legislative chambers. The 200 members of the National Council are elected every four years based on a refined proportional representation system with modifications for smaller cantons. The last federal election was held in October 2015 and the next will be held in 2019. The cantons are represented in the second chamber, the Council of States. Its 46 members represent the 20 full cantons (two representatives each) and the 6 half cantons (one representative). The two chambers discuss new laws separately in an iterative process until an agreement can be reached. Because representing a constituency in the Parliament is not a full-time job, parliament meets only 4 times per year for several weeks. The meetings are supplemented with one-day conferences of the different commissions, where members of parliament represent their parties’ interests. The seven members of the federal government form the ‘Bundesrat’ (Federal Council). As heads of government departments they hold equal rights and can be re-elected without legal limit to their total term of office. They meet weekly and take decisions either by majority voting or consensus. At the beginning of a new four-year term, the Federal Assembly consisting of the National Council and the Council of States elects the Federal Council in the December following the parliamentary election (and the frequently jointly held Council of States election). The Swiss Presidency rotates among the members of the Federal Council each year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Direct democracy plays a crucial role in the legislative process. There are frequent referenda on laws passed by the Parliament, some mandatory while others are discretionary if 50,000 citizens demand for it. Citizens can also submit proposals to change the Swiss constitution if supported by 100,000 signatures. The relatively small population and long tradition of direct democracy have so far had a stabilising effect on Swiss politics as they increase parties’ willingness to compromise, favour large coalitions and are likely to block extreme laws.</p>",true,26 cantons,"OECD, EIG",published

The new constitution empowers the military junta to select all 250 members of the Senate and gives those a role in selecting the Prime Minister, previously held solely by the House of Representatives. The Constitution also gives the military power to issue emergency decrees without parliamentary consent.</p>
<p>Under the new Constitution, the House of Representatives has 500 members, who are elected in general elections every four years. The voting system is a mixed-member majoritarian system. Voters have two votes. With their first vote, they directly elect 350 members of parliament in single constituency elections through the first-past-the-post system. The second vote is then based on proportional representation on a party list basis. According to the overall share of second votes obtained, each party gets a proportion of the remaining 150 seats. The upper house or Senate has 250 members, all of whom are appointed by the Government for five years (note, that under the 2007 constitution, the Senate was partially elected).</p>
<p>Laws are introduced to the National Assembly in the form of bills, typically by the Council of Ministers. Money-related bills require the endorsement of the Prime Minister. Bills can also be introduced by a minimum of 20 members of the House of Representatives or by petition exceeding 10,000 signatures. The legislative cycle begins in the House of Representatives, where a bill is debated, amended and voted on. If approved, it is passed on to the Senate. The bill is passed if the Senate gives its direct approval or if the Senate has not completed consideration of the bill within 60 days. In the case of rejection by the Senate, the bill is returned to the House of Representatives for reconsideration. In the case of persistent disagreement between the two houses a joint committee is formed. The Senate is granted veto power over the House of Representatives with regards to  amending the constitution. The committee prepares a report and the bill is resubmitted. It passes if both houses give their approval.

If the bill is adopted, a Committee of the Whole House then considers and scrutinises the bill clause-by-clause along with suggested amendments from the original Committee to which the bill was referred. When the Committee of the Whole House reports back to Parliament, the bill undergoes a Third (and final) Reading in which a vote is taken without further debate. Following the passage of a bill, it is forwarded to the President, whose assent is a Constitutional requirement for a law to come into force. The President has thirty days to sign a Bill or return it to Parliament. After the passage of the 30-day window, assent is assumed and the bill enters into force as an Act.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Draft bills are issued for consultation before being formally introduced to Parliament. A bill is a proposal for a new law, or a proposal to change an existing law that is presented for debate before Parliament. Bills are introduced in either the House of Commons or House of Lords for examination, discussion and amend­ment. When both Houses have agreed on the content of a bill, it is presented to the monarch for Royal Assent. Once Royal Assent is given, a bill becomes an Act of Parliament and is law. An Act of Parliament creates a new law or changes an existing law.</p>

If approved (reported) by the committee, the bill reaches the floor of the chamber. Once a bill is approved by one chamber, it is sent to the other, which may pass, reject or amend it. In order for a proposed bill to become law, both chambers must agree on identical versions of the bill and the President must sign it. If the President vetoes a bill, the veto can be overturned if a two-thirds majority of both chambers vote to do so.</p>",true,"50 states, 1 federal district; 16 territories","G20, OECD",published

195,Vanuatu,VUT,National,East Asia & Pacific,"<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The legal system of the Republic of Vanuatu combines English common law, French civil law and indigenous customary law. The Parliament of Vanuatu is a unicameral legislative body that comprises 52 members, directly elected for four-year terms. The republic was formed in 1980, after 74 years of joint British and French administration. The constitution allows for three arms of government: the executive (Prime Minister and cabinet, also known as the Council of Ministers), the legislature (members of parliament) and the judiciary (judges of the courts).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Republic of Vanuatu comprises seventeen multi-member constituencies, with the most recent general election held in 2012. The next general election is expected in October 2016. The parliament is derived from the Westminster system and includes a President, elected for a five-year term by members of parliament and the presidents of Vanuatu’s local government councils (who together comprise the Electoral College). The President is largely a figurehead, and may not veto parliamentary legislation unless the Supreme Court considers it to be contrary to the constitution. Parliament elects the Prime Minister from among its members. The cabinet may not number more than 13 (a quarter of the members of parliament), including the Prime Minister. The Malvatumauri (National Council of Chiefs) acts as a formal advisory body to the parliament on issues related to culture and language.  Members of this council are elected from district councils of chiefs.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Proposed laws may be private bills (presented by members of parliament who are not ministers) or government bills (presented by ministers). Bills pass through three stages. At the first reading, the bill is presented as a motion to be agreed to in parliament and a debate is held about the principles and merits of the bill. In the second stage, it is automatically passed to a committee of the whole house, unless it is decided to refer it to an ad hoc committee. Ad hoc committees consist of a maximum of seven members of parliament, proportionally representative of the political parties represented in parliament, and follow the same procedures as a committee of the whole house.  At the committee stage, the bill is considered and voted section by section. Once a bill has been considered by the committee of the whole house it passes into the third and final stage, known as the second reading.  At the second reading, after Parliament reads the bill as amended, a motion is put forward to pass the bill into law at which a final vote is held. All laws are published in English and French. Relevant government departments write roadmaps, action plans and other strategies, which become guiding documents for policy once officially launched by the government.</p>",false,,"LDC, G77, SIDS, AOSIS",published

The last election took place in December 2015, the next is expected for 2020.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Law projects (bills) are proposed by members of the National Assembly and go through two readings. Unless rejected during the first reading, the bill is sent to the corresponding legislative committee to elaborate the legal text. In the second reading, the bill is debated article by article.

Should serious objections be raised, amendments will be proposed and the bill will return to the designated committee for revision.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Cabinet Ministers are appointed by the President, who is selected from the Members of Parliament. Laws can be proposed either as public, private or hybrid laws. Public bills relate to matters of public interest introduced by the Members of Parliament (Private Members Bills), which can be originated from either of the two houses. Private laws are introduced for the interest or benefit of the person or bodies of persons who prompt the bill; private laws affect only particular individuals or a group of people, e.g. the Zimbabwe Institution of Engineers Act that only affects engineers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hybrid bills are public or private bills that are associated with both public and private interests. Bills go through preliminary stages before they are brought to the Parliament; public bills introduced by members of the Executive require proposals from the responsible Minister, approval by the Cabinet and publishing in the Government Gazette. The Portfolio Committee that administers the bills under the relevant ministries consults the public through public hearings or oral evidence interviews, by which the output is presented in the reading stage of parliamentary discussion. Bills are passed at first in the originating House by a simple majority of the MPs present at the time of voting. Bills are then transmitted to the other House for the second reading and voting. The President is required to assent to the bill within 21 days, otherwise the bill is returned to the Parliament. The Constitution provides that in case of disagreements between the two houses not resolved within 90 days, the bill may be presented to the President to assent in the form it was passed in the House of Assembly. Once the President assents, the bill becomes an Act. Private bills are brought in by motion, which in case of approval by the house the bills are introduced in the Parliament for reading and voting.</p>",false,,G77,published
