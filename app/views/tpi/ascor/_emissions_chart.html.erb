  text: "<p>Country emission pathways are assessed in several ways to account for a variety of factors and uncertainties. The emission metrics considered include the following options: production and consumption-based emissions; exclusion of LULUCF emissions and LULUCF emissions alone; and emissions on an absolute and intensity basis (per capita and per PPP-adjusted GDP).</p>" \
        "<p>Targeted future pathways are included only for absolute production-based emissions excluding LULUCF as this is the basis on which 2030 targets are assessed.</p>" \
        "<p>Pathways end in 2030 because long-term net zero targets are often stated on a different emission boundary from the one considered in the 2030 target assessments (e.g. including only COâ‚‚ emissions rather than all Kyoto greenhouse gases).</p>",
