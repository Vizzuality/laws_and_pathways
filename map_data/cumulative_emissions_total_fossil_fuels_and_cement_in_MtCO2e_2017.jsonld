  "description": "This dataset shows cumulative carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions grouped by country; the total quantity of CO₂ emissions emitted from 1751 until 2017, measured in megatonnes. This is based on territorial emissions, which do not account for emissions embedded in traded goods. Cumulative carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions have been calculated by Our World in Data based on annual CO₂ emissions published by the Global Carbon Project (GCP) and Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC). By summing the annual emissions to a given year we have calculated the cumulative total. This is given as the share of global cumulative emissions by dividing each country or region's cumulative emissions by the cumulative world emissions for that given year. Data has been converted by Our World in Data from tonnes of carbon to tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO₂) using a conversion factor of 3.664. Our World in Data have renamed the category 'bunker fuels' as 'International transport' which includes emissions from international aviation and shipping. We have renamed this category for clarity. Historical data for Australia in CDIAC from 1820 until 1860 reports negative CO2 emissions. In this dataset, pre-1860 data for Australia has been removed. Data from pre-1959 is sourced from the archived Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Centre (CDIAC).

Data from 1959 onwards is sourced from the Global Carbon Project (2018). Full reference of the Global Carbon Budget (2018): Corinne Le Quéré, Robbie M.
